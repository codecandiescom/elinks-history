This is the ELusive project, sub-project of the ELinks project. Here, we aim
to rewrite the ELinks HTML engine in a sane way ;-).

The problem is, that now it's all very messy and chaotic. We randomly jump
around over the document source, skipping various parts and interpreting
others, etc etc.  This is ugly. We should ONCE pass thru the whole file and
parse it (and don't mix parser and renderer in one file), store the syntactic
tree and then walk thru it. Sure that it'll be a bit more tricky as we won't
know the whole document source at once frequently, but this is doable.

See TODO file for TODO list.

Structure:

parser  : it will construct a syntactic tree from the source
layouter: it will create a page layout from the tree in some abstract
          fashion
          (??? - not sure about this, maybe we'll drop this layer)
renderer: it will create some image of the layout
[viewer : it will display the image of the layout - this one will live in
          ELinks itself]
