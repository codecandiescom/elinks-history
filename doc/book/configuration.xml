<sect1><title>The configuration file</title>

<para>


	The &elinks.conf; file contains configuration information for ELinks.  It
	can be used to configure the behaviour of ELinks in a wide variety of
	ways: protocol behaviour, keybindings, colors used for rendering and
	for the user interface.

	It is read at startup and saved only when requested. All options
	described in this document can be fully configured from within ELinks
	so no editing of elinks.conf is needed.

	Note that MIME-related options used for specifying handlers of various
	MIME types are NOT described in this document. Documentation for these
	options can be found at the ELinks homepage. Keybindings can also be

	page.

<sect2><title>The Syntax</title>

<para>

	The syntax of the config file is very simple. The elinks.conf file is
	a free-form ASCII text file. The file may contain extra tabs and
	newlines for formatting purposes. Keywords in the file are
	case-sensitive. Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except
	within quotes). Comments begin with the # character and end at the end
	of the line.
