TODO list for links (sorted approximatelly by priority):


	Resuming of downloads (URGENT)

	Show all downloads in one window, kind of "download manager"

	Passive FTP mode support (needed since client-side firewalls may
block FTP data connections from servers in active mode); IPv6 FTP support

	Rewrite html parser

	CSS support

	Support for <xmp>

	Better support for vlink - we have to update already rendered document

	Use terminfo instead of hardwired ANSI control sequences

	Improve keybinding so that it works more universally

	Mouse buttonbinding ;)

	User interface for keys rebinding

	User interface for options changing

	Reorganization of user interface

	When calling external viewer on files, assign temporary files the
suffix appropriate to the file type (?)

	Cookies manager

	HTTPS proxy support (!) (I have no idea how to do it so someone else
have to; good job for wannabe ELinks developer ;)

	Take info about proxies from env variables (?)

	Passing url to external command (possibly make alt+[0-9] to pass
current link to external command (?)).

	A mechanism that does not overwrite files: If two files are to be
saved in the same dir with the same name links should do someting like wget,
which adds .1, .2 ... on the filename and does not overwrite the file that
existed first.

	Insert should toggle insert/overwrite mode.

	Disk cache


These are more long-term goals:


	EcmaScript (http://home.worldcom.ch/~jmlugrin/fesi/)

	Then, support for proxy autoconfiguration
(http://www.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html).

	Multiple windows in one console

	Possibility to use commandline-driven interface instead of BFU
optionally.

	Generic code cleanup

	Write some more documentation
