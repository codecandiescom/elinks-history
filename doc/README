	   Documentation README - Overview of the ELinks documentation	[title]

   There is only limited documentation available for ELinks, sorry. It basically
   consists of the documents in this directory and the manpages + README/INSTALL
   files in the project's root directory.

The directory structure							[sect1]

   In this directory you will find:

   man/									[term]

	The place where the manpages live. They are generated from the DocBook
	documents found in doc/book/manpages.

   html/								[term]

	Will (in the future) contain processed DocBook documents.  Manual pages
	and man pages should be already processed.

ELinks DocTool								[sect1]

   Since [DocBook] seems to be a lot of work to get it running on multiple
   platforms I am investigating going for something simpler. Something that will
   need only the standard UN*X tools to run, an ELinks doctool. This tool will
   be build upon some achitecture similar to [help2doc] currently used for
   generate [elinks.conf(5)].

  The format								[sect2]

   The basic format will be something similar to how ELinks renders html pages
   and probably inspired by [AsciiDoc] and [Vim] help files. We can then easily
   and without any extra luggage distribute the documentation source (human
   readable plain text files like this one) with the source. Any user can then:

	% cd doc && make htmldocs

   or similar to generate a desired format. It will support translation to the
   core formats: html and man. Which means it will also be used for the web
   pages. With possibility to extend it with DocBook later.

  Other uses								[sect2]

   One thing I'd also like to use it for is the option declarations. The current
   scheme is hard to read and update. Something like:

	= Option =							[code]
	Name:	tofu.burgers.rock
	Type:	boolean
	Value:	1
	Flags:	0

   or similar that could easily be translated to some options.inc would be much
   better. This is however far ahead and solely my opinion.

   TODO: The first step will be to translate this document to html.
   TODO: Vim syntax file to highlight this txt file.
