When you add or delete any text, add or delete it in english.lng and run script
./synclang. It adds NULL entries to other languages, then it runs ./gen-intl.

When you change any text, run ./get-intl. It will generate big header file from
the language files and place it inside src/intl/.

Menu hotkeys are also translated via this interface. You can specify more
hotkeys. When using normal letters as hotkeys, always use upper case. When using
some characters above 128, specify both upper and lower letters.
