Known bugs:

- Tilde doesn't expand as it should when used in goto dialog, ~ -> /home and ~/
  -> current directory.

- When a page displayed as plain-text includes '<title>' and '</title>', then
  the enclosed text is displayed as the page's title.

- Frames don't work if there's more frames with same name. Turn them off in such
  case.

- When a frame's src is a plain-text file, that file is rendered as HTML.

- In a frameset, following a link to a plain-text file breaks out of the frames.

- Loading a page in a frame does not add that page to the global history.

- The 'enter' action does not cause a refresh, even when given a prefix.  Thus
  the newly selected link is not highlighted.

- You can't upload large files; it takes _lots_ of memory.

- You shouldn't press '^Z' when you are in a viewer

- Handling of &#13; is not lynx-compatible in <pre> tag (should be newline).

- Tags inside <XMP> are still interpreted.

- When switching between source view and rendered view, the position of the view
  is based on the page number of the previous view, not on the content of the
  previous view.

- Calling cfmakeraw() in kbd.c:setraw() breaks some exotic terminal
  combinations.

- Handling of textareas splitted to two pages is just weird.  (Is this still
  true with 0.5 CVS?)

- Call to OS Shell doesn't release mouse handler.

- Spaces added by justification are not highlighted in links when those links
  are selected.

- Searches match links' prefixes (when document.browse.links.numbering = 1).

- <li>foo</li><li></li><li>bar</li> displays the bullets for the second two
  <li>s on the same line.

- The newline displayed before a list is superfluous when that list is nested
  under another list.


Key: - nothing done + work in progress * almost ready
