TODO list for ELinks (sorted approximatelly by priority):

	Speed optimalizations

	Some rules for sane handling of texinfo documentation

	Generic supports for adding of new protocols and external handlers
for them; dummy javascript support (just an error message)

	Use real lines instead of ASCII art for the hiearchic bookmarks

	Show all downloads in one window, kind of "download manager"

	Forward/backward history manager

	Rewrite html parser

	CSS support

	Support for <xmp>

	Better support for vlink - we have to update already rendered document

	Use terminfo instead of hardwired ANSI control sequences

	Improve keybinding so that it works more universally

	Mouse buttonbinding ;)

	Reorganization of user interface

	Use locale+gettext for translations instead of Mikulas' intl

	When calling external viewer on files, assign temporary files the
suffix appropriate to the file type (?)

	Cookies manager

	HTTPS proxy support (!) (I have no idea how to do it so someone else
have to; good job for wannabe ELinks developer ;)

	Take info about proxies from env variables (?)

	Passing url to external command (possibly make alt+[0-9] to pass
current link to external command (?)).

	Insert should toggle insert/overwrite mode.

	Disk cache
	
	Bandwidth limiter for file downloads.

	Copy url to X clipboard (using X selections).


These are more long-term goals:


	EcmaScript (http://home.worldcom.ch/~jmlugrin/fesi/)

	Then, support for proxy autoconfiguration
(http://www.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html).

	Graphics support

	Multiple windows in one console

	Possibility to use commandline-driven interface instead of BFU
optionally.

	Generic code cleanup

	Write some more documentation.. docs, a lot of docs!
