The ELinks TODO items are kept in Bugzilla (http://bugzilla.elinks.or.cz/),
look for the bugs with 'enhancement' severity. Some generic goals are still
kept here, though, to be more on the developers' eyes ;-).


What yet needs to take its way to Bugzilla:

  Some rules for sane handling of texinfo documentation

  Rewrite HTML parser (see ELusive, src/elusive/TODO)

  Reorganization of user interface (nothing particular at all, just an
uncertain feel that it could be better and bear a look of some UI designer ;)


General goals:

  Write some more documentation.. docs, a lot of docs! (see doc/book/TODO)

  General code cleanup

  Speed/memory optimizations
