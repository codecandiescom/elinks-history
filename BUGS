Known bugs:

Can't connect to some FTP servers (Novell, NT). Connection stays in "Request
sent" state.

Frames don't work if there's more frames with same name. Turn them off in such
case.

You can't upload large files; it takes _lots_ of memory.

You shouldn't press '^Z' when you are in a viewer

When site has more RR records, links probes only the first one, even if
connection is refused.

Handling of &#13; is not lynx-compatible in <pre> tag (should be newline).

Textarea editor calling is broken.

vim: textwidth=80
