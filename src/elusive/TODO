[GENERIC]

  * Scripting hooks (for ECMAScript).
  * Split this TODO list to appropriate subdirs...?
  * Caching interface (allowing syntax trees and layout outputs to be cached).
  * Untie ELusive from ELinks, make it possible to build it as a separate
    reusable library (or set of libraries). That's rather a more long-term
    goal, though. However you should keep that in mind when implementing stuff
    and avoid direct calls back to ELinks (except maybe for util/ stuff).



[PARSER]

  * Generic XML parser

    STATUS:

      The XML parser lives in html/ disguise yet. It will be moved.

      Basic parsing is now implemented, without correct support for entities
      and HTML compatibility support for elements with optional or none closing
      tag (for now, only tags starting by ! aren't checked for closing pair
      tag).

    TODO:

      - Values parsing to some usable form (ie. struct rgb or raw numbers).
      - Reformating of text portions - whitespace transformations and removal.
      - !DOCTYPE parsing.
      - Reuse info gained by DTD parser.


  * (X)HTML parser

    STATUS:

      Not done.

    TODO:

      - XHTML parser - it should be a front-end for XML parser, implementing
        special tags like <XMP> or <FRAMESET>.
      - XHTML 1.0 DTD in pre-compiled form, merged with HTML 4.01 DTD in some
        sane way.


  * Generic DTD parser

    STATUS:

      Not done.

    TODO:

      - DTD parsing ;-)


  * CSS parser

    STATUS:

      Not done. Jonas should be working on it.

    TODO:

      - CSS parsing


  * XSLT parser

    STATUS:

      Not done.

    TODO:

      - XSLT parsing... maybe CSS should be then re-done to provide
        XSLT-compatible output?



[LAYOUTER]

  * HTML layouter

    STATUS:

      Not done.

    TODO:

      - XML layouter - take HTML and CSS and XSLT syntree and work something
        out.
      - Dunno if we should have special layouter optimized for HTML? We'll see.


  * Syntree layouter

    STATUS:

      The basic support is there. Rather very simplistic yet, in fact for
      testing of basic capabilities of renderer rather than for displaying of
      the syntax tree ;-).

    TODO:

      - Support for indentation - that's kinda requirement ;-).
      - Nicer rendering, utilizing various text decorations and similiars.
      - Support for CSS specifying details about formatting of such tree.



[RENDERER]

  * Text renderer

    STATUS:

      Not done.

    TODO:

      - Take document layout and format it to array of form items, links, lines
        and line attributes, compatible with the current ELinks text viewer, if
        possible.


  * Graphics renderer

    STATUS:

      Not done. Depends on generic ELinks graphics support ;-).

    TODO:

      - Take document layout and format it to array of form items, links and
        graphics "objects". Should just take adjusting of layout rectangles to
        the viewport dimensions and some attributes transformations.
