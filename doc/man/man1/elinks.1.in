.SH NAME
elinks \- lynx-like alternative character mode WWW browser
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIelinks\fR [options] [url]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


\fIELinks\fR is a text mode WWW browser, supporting colors, table rendering, background downloading, menu driven configuration interface, tabbed browsing and slim code\&.


Frames are supported\&. You can have different file formats associated with external viewers\&. mailto: and telnet: are supported via external clients\&.


ELinks can handle both local files and remote URLs\&. The main supported remote URL protocols are \fIHTTP\fR, \fIHTTPS\fR (with SSL support compiled in) and \fIFTP\fR\&. Additional protocol support exists for \fIfinger\fR, \fIGopher\fR, \fISMB\fR and \fINNTP\fR\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"


Most options can be set in the user interface or config file, so usually you do not need to care about them\&. Note that this list is by no means complete and it is not kept up\-to\-date\&. To get complete list of commandline options, start \fIELinks\fR with parameter --help\&.

.TP
\-anonymous [0|1] (default: 0)
Restricts \fIELinks\fR so it can run on an anonymous account\&. Local file browsing, downloads, and modification of options will be disabled\&. Execution of viewers is allowed, but entries in the association table can't be added or modified\&.

.TP
\-auto\-submit [0|1] (default: 0)
Automatically submit the first form in the given URLs\&.

.TP
\-base\-session <num> (default: 0)
Used internally when opening \fIELinks\fR instances in new windows\&. The ID maps to information that will be used when creating the new instance\&. You don't want to use it\&.

.TP
\-config\-dir <str> (default: "")
Path of the directory \fIELinks\fR will read and write its config and runtime state files to instead of ~/\&.elinks\&. If the path does not begin with a '/' it is assumed to be relative to your \fIHOME\fR directory\&.

.TP
\-config\-file <str> (default: "elinks\&.conf")
Name of the configuration file that all configuration options will be read from and written to\&. It should be relative to config\-dir\&.

.TP
\-config\-help
Print help for configuration options and exit\&.

.TP
\-default\-mime\-type (alias for mime\&.default_type)
The default MIME type used for documents of unknown type\&.

.TP
\-default\-keys [0|1] (default: 0)
When set, all keybindings from configuration files will be ignored\&. It forces use of default keybindings and will reset user\-defined ones on save\&.

.TP
\-dump [0|1] (default: 0)
Print formatted plain\-text versions of given URLs to stdout\&.

.TP
\-dump\-charset (alias for document\&.dump\&.codepage)
Codepage used when formatting dump output\&.

.TP
\-dump\-width (alias for document\&.dump\&.width)
Width of the dump output\&.

.TP
\-eval
Specify configuration file directives on the command\-line which will be evaluated after all configuration files has been read\&. Example usage:

.nf

\-eval 'set protocol\&.file\&.allow_special_files = 1'

.fi

.TP
\-force\-html
Makes \fIELinks\fR assume documents of unknown types are HTML\&. Useful when using \fIELinks\fR as an external viewer from MUAs\&. This is equivalent to \-default\-mime\-type  text/html\&.

.TP
\-?, \-h, \-help
Print usage help and exit\&.

.TP
\-localhost [0|1] (default: 0)
Restricts \fIELinks\fR to work offline and only connect to servers with local addresses (ie\&. 127\&.0\&.0\&.1)\&. No connections to remote servers will be permitted\&.

.TP
\-long\-help
Print detailed usage help and exit\&.

.TP
\-lookup
Look up specified host and print all DNS resolved IP addresses\&.

.TP
\-no\-connect [0|1] (default: 0)
Run \fIELinks\fR as a separate instance instead of connecting to an existing instance\&. Note that normally no runtime state files (bookmarks, history, etc\&.) are written to the disk when this option is used\&. See also \-touch\-files\&.

.TP
\-no\-home [0|1] (default: 0)
Disables creation and use of files in the user specific home configuration directory (~/\&.elinks)\&. It forces default configuration values to be used and disables saving of runtime state files\&.

.TP
\-no\-numbering [0|1] (default: 0)
Prevents printing of link number in dump output\&. Note that this really affects only \-dump, nothing else\&.

.TP
\-no\-references [0|1] (default: 0)
Prevents printing of references (URIs) of document links in dump output\&. Note that this really affects only \-dump, nothing else\&.

.TP
\-remote
Control a remote \fIELinks\fR instance by passing commands to it\&. The option takes an additional argument containing the method which should be invoked and any parameters that should be passed to it\&. For ease of use, the additional method argument can be omitted in which case any URL arguments will be opened in new tabs in the remote instance\&. Following is a list of the supported methods:

.RS
.TP 3
\(bu
 ping(): look for a remote instance
.TP
\(bu
 openURL(): prompt URL in current tab
.TP
\(bu
 openURL(URL): open URL in current tab
.TP
\(bu
 openURL(URL, new\-tab): open URL in new tab
.TP
\(bu
 openURL(URL, new\-window): open URL in new window
.TP
\(bu
 addBookmark(URL): bookmark URL
.TP
\(bu
 xfeDoCommand(openBrowser): open new window
.LP
.RE
.IP

.TP
\-session\-ring <num> (default: 0)
ID of session ring this \fIELinks\fR session should connect to\&. \fIELinks\fR works in so\-called session rings, whereby all instances of \fIELinks\fR are interconnected and share state (cache, bookmarks, cookies, and so on)\&. By default, all \fIELinks\fR instances connect to session ring 0\&. You can change that behaviour with this switch and form as many session rings as you want\&. Obviously, if the session\-ring with this number doesn't exist yet, it's created and this 'ELinks' instance will become the master instance (that usually doesn't matter for you as a user much)\&. Note that you usually don't want to use this unless you're a developer and you want to do some testing \- if you want the \fIELinks\fR instances each running standalone, rather use the \-no\-connect command\-line option\&. Also note that normally no runtime state files are written to the disk when this option is used\&. See also \-touch\-files\&.

.TP
\-source [0|1] (default: 0)
Print given URLs in source form to stdout\&.

.TP
\-touch\-files [0|1] (default: 0)
When enabled, runtime state files (bookmarks, history, etc\&.) are written to disk, even when \-no\-connect or \-session\-ring is used\&. The option has no effect if not used in conjunction with any of these options\&.

.TP
\-verbose <num> (default: 1)
The verbose level controls what messages are shown at start up and while running:

.RS
.TP 3
\(bu
0: means only show serious errors
.TP
\(bu
1: means show serious errors and warnings
.TP
\(bu
2: means show all messages
.LP
.RE
.IP

.TP
\-version
Print \fIELinks\fR version information and exit\&.
