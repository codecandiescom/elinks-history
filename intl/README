When you add or delete any text, add or delete it in english.lng and run script
./synclang. It adds NULL entries to other languages, then it runs ./gen-intl.

When you change any text, run ./get-intl. It will generate big header file from
the language files and place it inside src/intl/.

Menu hotkeys are also translated via this interface. You can specify more
hotkeys. When using normal letters as hotkeys, always use upper case. When using
some characters above 128, specify both upper and lower letters.

There's a nice guide written by Petr Kulhavy <brain@artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>
and Petr Baudis <pasky@ucw.cz>:

Instructions how to add a new language to ELinks:

* cd intl
* cp english.lng your_language.lng
* vi your language.lng
* change the string in quotes on the line T__CHAR_SET to the charset of your
translation
* change the string in quotes on the line T__LANGUAGE to name of your language
* change the string in quotes on the line T__ISO_639_CODE to code of your
language (note that this is tricky a bit if your language code is variant of
another language, see src/intl/language.c, comment near language_iso639_code(),
for details)
* translate all the texts (T_<something>) to your language, don't mangle
* small and capital letters
* change the hotkeys (T_HK_<something>) to hotkey you want
* vi index.txt
* add your language (only the name without the .lng suffix) to
* index.txt on single line
* ./synclang
* cd ..
* make
* check if the translation is correct
* send it to links-discuss
