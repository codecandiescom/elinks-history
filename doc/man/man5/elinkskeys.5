.SH NAME
elinkskeys \- keybindings for ELinks
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Key bindings for  elinks  should be placed
in a file called \fI~/.elinks/elinks.conf\fR. Note that
any information regarding their format/structure may not be up-to-date.
If you will discover that, please feed us with a patch.
.PP
Key binding statements are of the form:

.nf

	bind  "\fBkeymap\fR" "\fBkeystroke\fR" = "\fBaction\fR"
.fi
.PP
where:
.TP
\fB keymap \fR
is main, edit, or
menu.
.TP
\fB keystroke \fR
is a case sensitive key, which you can prefix with
Ctrl- or Alt-.
Ctrl- must be followed by an uppercase key.
See below for a list of valid keys.
.TP
\fB action \fR
is what the key should do.  The actions available are dependent
on the keymap, and are listed separately below.
.PP
All words/strings may all be quoted "like so".  Backslashes are escape
characters, even if not between quotes.  Lines beginning with a hash
character (#) are comments.
.PP
Keys can be unbound just by binding them to "none" action.  It may be
of use if you accidentally type a key often.
.SH "KEYS"
.PP
Valid keys are: alphanumeric characters, punctuation, Enter, Backspace,
Tab, Escape, Left, Right, Up, Down, Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp,
PageDown, F1 to F12.
.PP
Some keys will need to be quoted or escaped.  For example, space can be
written as " " (quote space quote), and the quote itself as \\"
(backslash quote).  Backslash can be written as \\\\ (double
backslash).
