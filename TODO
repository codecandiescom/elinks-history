TODO list for ELinks (sorted approximatelly by priority):

- Change msg_box to use printf-style formats

- Some rules for sane handling of texinfo documentation

- Show all downloads in one window, kind of "download manager"

- Forward/backward history manager

- <include ELusive TODO here ;>

- Rewrite HTML parser

- CSS support

- Support for <xmp>

- Better support for vlink - we have to update already rendered document

- Use terminfo instead of hardwired ANSI control sequences

- Improve keybinding so that it works more universally

- Mouse buttonbinding ;)

- Show certain information specified with <meta> and <link> tags in the
  Document Info box

- Display links to or with images with a distinct colour

- Kill-ring for edit-boxes

- Support nested <sub>script tags. Maybe use parentheses to disambiguate
  superscript?

- Allow resizing of frames

- Show selected link's title (which is specified by the title attribute) in the
  statusbar

- Support using the hardstatus line to display current page's title, URL, or
  whatever

- Use the alternate screen (terminfo capabilities smcup and rmcup) in XTerms
  and GNU Screen

- Allow multiple transfers to be queued up instead of cancelling the currently
  queued item when back is pressed

- Support prefixes for more bindings; candidates: goto-url-current-link,
  add-bookmark-link, back, unback, document-info, next-frame, previous-frame,
  tab-prev, tab-next, tab-close, zoom-frame

- Show any info that can be found in globhist for the selected link in the Info
  box

- Optimize multiple _()s of the same strings by using temporary variables

- Allow the output from MIME handlers to be displayed in ELinks

- Add Lua APIs to manipulate bookmarks

- Reorganization of user interface

- When calling external viewer on files, assign temporary files the suffix
  appropriate to the file type (?)

- Cookie manager

- HTTPS proxy support (!) (I have no idea how to do it so someone else will
  have to; good job for a wannabe ELinks developer ;)

- Take info about proxies from env variables (?)

- Passing URL to external command (possibly make alt+[0-9] to pass current link
  to external command (?)).

- Insert should toggle insert/overwrite mode.

- Disk cache

- Bandwidth limiter for file downloads.

- Copy URL to X clipboard (using X selections).


Bookmarks/listboxes:

- Sessions: Bookmark the current page of each tab or window under a single
  folder.

- Complementary 'open all bookmarks in folder' or 'open all marked bookmarks'
  buttons in the bookmark mgr.

- Support for bookmarked-link colour in addition to visited-link colour

- 'Search' in the bookmark mgr. should be able to search collapsed folders

- Expand or collapse recursively and expand or collapse all folders in
  hierarchical listboxes

- Highlight marked listbox items instead of or in addition to putting asterisks
  next to them


Search improvements:

- Alert user when he attempts to follow a broken link to a fragment on the
  current page

- Include search string in 'Search string not found' error box

- Incremental-search

- Configurable highlight colour for text matched after a search


Permanent goals:

- General code cleanup

- Write some more documentation.. docs, a lot of docs!

- Speed optimizations


These are more long-term goals:

- EcmaScript (http://home.worldcom.ch/~jmlugrin/fesi/)

- Then, support for proxy autoconfiguration
  (http://www.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html)

- Graphics support

- Possibility to use commandline-driven interface instead of BFU optionally

- Generalised scripting interface, possibly using SWIG (http://www.swig.org/)


Key: - nothing done + work in progress * almost ready
