This directory contains unsorted stuff contributed by other people, which is
not incorporated to main links distribution, however may be still interesting
for someone. You will find here i.e. example configuration files or patches,
which weren't (possibly yet) for some reason applied. Note that this stuff is
mostly unmaintained and is not guaranteed to work, apply, compile etc. However,
if you feel like fixing that, no problem.
