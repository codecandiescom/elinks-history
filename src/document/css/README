This is a super-simplistic CSS micro-engine.

What Is Gonna Be A FAQ: Why isn't the CSS support compile-time optional?

Answer: Because I want to eliminate all trivial styling (like html_h*()) and
substitute it with default stylesheet information, so that this can be
user-configured. On the other side we might yet reconsider whether we want that
before 1.0. Maybe we don't.

TODO: Its job is separated to two phases. The first phase is a parser, it takes
a string with CSS code and transforms it to an internal set of structures
describing the data (let's call it a "rawer"). The second phase is an applier,
which applies given rawer to the current element. --pasky

Currently only the element's 'style' attribute is checked, therefore the first
stage is not exported yet (it'd be useless for that). Only the second stage is
available now, and it doesn't take the stylesheet argument yet.  It will
automatically scan the current element, and if a 'style' attribute is found, it
is parsed and applied to the current element.
