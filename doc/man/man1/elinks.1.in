.SH NAME
elinks \- lynx-like alternative character mode WWW browser
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBelinks\fR [ \fBoptions\fR ] \fBurl\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ELinks is a text mode WWW browser, supporting colors,
table rendering, background downloading, menu driven
configuration interface, tabbed browsing and slim code. 
.PP
Frames are supported. You can have different file formats associated
with external viewers. mailto: and telnet: are supported via external
clients. 
.PP
ELinks can handle both local files and remote URLs. The main
supported remote URL protocols are HTTP, HTTPS (with SSL support
compiled in) and FTP. Additional protocol support exists for finger,
Gopher, SMB and NNTP.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Most options can be set in the user interface or config file, so
usually you do not need to care about them. Note that this list is by
no means complete and it is not kept up-to-date. To get complete list
of commandline options, start ELinks with parameter
\fI--help\fR.
.TP
\fB-anonymous [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Restrict ELinks so that it can run on an anonymous account.
No local file browsing, no downloads and no saving of runtime state
files. Execution of viewers is allowed, but user can't add or modify
entries in association table.
.TP
\fB-auto-submit [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Go and submit the first form you'll stumble upon.
.TP
\fB-base-session <num> (default: 0) \fR
ID of session (ELinks instance) which we want to clone.
This is internal ELinks option, you don't want to use it.
.TP
\fB-config-dir <str> (default: "") \fR
Set the config dir to the given path. ELinks will read
its config files and writes to it. If the path begins with
a '/' its used as an absolute path. Else it is assumed to
be relative to your \fBHOME\fR dir.
.TP
\fB-config-file <str> (default: "elinks.conf")\fR
Name of the file with configuration, from which and to
which all the configuration shall be written. It should be
relative to config-dirP
\fB-config-help\fR
Print help on configuration options and exit.
.TP
\fB-default-mime-type (alias for mime.default_type) \fR
Default MIME type to assume for documents of unknown type.
.TP
\fB-default-keys [0|1] (default: 0)\fR
If set, parse but don't set keybindings from configuration
file. It forces use of default keybindings and will reset
user-defined ones on save.
.TP
\fB-dump [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Write a plain-text version of the document at the given URL to stdout.
.TP
\fB-dump-charset (alias for document.dump.codepage) \fR
Codepage used in dump output.
.TP
\fB-dump-width (alias for document.dump.width) \fR
Width of the dump output.
.TP
\fB-eval \fR
Specify elinks.conf configuration options on the command-line:
\fI-eval 'set protocol.file.allow_special_files = 1'\fR.
.TP
\fB-force-html \fR
This makes ELinks assume that the files it sees are HTML. This is
equivalent to \fI-default-mime-type text/html\fR.
.TP
\fB-?, -h, -help \fR
Print usage help and exit.
.TP
\fB-localhost [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Restrict ELinks so that it can only open connections to
local addresses (ie. 127.0.0.1), it will prevent any connection
to distant servers.
.TP
\fB-long-help \fR
Print detailed usage help and exit.
.TP
\fB-lookup \fR
Look up specified host.
.TP
\fB-no-connect [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Run ELinks as a separate instance instead of connecting to an
existing instance. Note that normally no runtime state files
(bookmarks, history and so on) are written to the disk when
this option is used. See also \fI-touch-files\fR.
.TP
\fB-no-home [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Disables creation and use of files in the user specific home
configuration directory (\fI~/.elinks\fR). It forces default
configuration values to be used and disables saving of state
files (e.g. cookies).
.TP
\fB-no-numbering [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Prevents numbering of links in the \fI-dump\fR. output; this was the
default behaviour until 0.5pre12.
Note that this really affects only \fI-dump\fR, nothing else.
.TP
\fB-no-references [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Prevents dumping of links references (URIs) in the \fI-dump\fR output.
Note that this really affects only \fI-dump\fR, nothing else.
.TP
\fB-remote\fR
Mozilla compliant support for controlling a remote ELinks instance.
The command takes an additional argument containing the method which
should be invoked and any parameters that should be passed to it.
For ease of use the additional method argument can be omitted in which
case any URL arguments will be opened in new tabs in the remote instance.
Following is a list of the methods that are supported:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B ping()
check for remote instance
.TP
.B openURL()
prompt URL in current tab
.TP
.B openURL(URL)
open URL in current tab
.TP
.B openURL(URL, new-tab)
open URL in new tab
.TP
.B openURL(URL, new-window)
open URL in new window
.TP
.B addBookmark(URL)
bookmark URL
.TP
.B xfeDoCommand(openBrowser)
open new window
.PD
.RE
.TP
\fB-session-ring <num> (default: 0) \fR
ID of session ring this ELinks session should connect to. ELinks
works in so-called session rings, whereby all instances of ELinks
are interconnected and share state (cache, bookmarks, cookies,
and so on). By default, all ELinks instances connect to session
ring 0. You can change that behaviour with this switch and form as
many session rings as you want. Obviously, if the session-ring with
this number doesn't exist yet, it's created and this ELinks instance
will become the master instance (that usually doesn't matter for you
as a user much). Note that you usually don't want to use this unless
you're a developer and you want to do some testing - if you want the
ELinks instances each running standalone, rather use the \fI-no-connect\fR
command-line option. Also note that normally no runtime state files
are written to the disk when this option is used. See also
\fI-touch-files\fR.
.TP
\fB-source [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Write the given HTML document in source form to stdout.
.TP
\fB-touch-files [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Set to 1 to have runtime state files (bookmarks, history, ...)
changed even when \fI-no-connect\fR or \fI-session-ring\fR is used; has no
effect if not used in connection with any of these options.
.TP
\fB-verbose <num> (default: 0) \fR
The verbose level controls what messages are shown at
start up and while running:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B 0
means only show serious errors
.TP
.B 1
means show serious errors and warnings
.TP
.B 2
means show all messages
.PD
.RE
.TP
\fB-version \fR
Print ELinks version information and exit.
