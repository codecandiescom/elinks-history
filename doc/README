		Few words about documentation for ELinks

There is only limited documentation available for ELinks, sorry. It basically
consists of the documents in this directory and the manpages + README/INSTALL
files in the project's root directory.

Other things you will find in this directory are:

	man/  -	The place where the manpages live. They are generated from the
		DocBook documents found in doc/book/manpages.

	html/ - Will (in the future) contain processed DocBook documents.
		Manual pages and man pages should be already processed.

ELinks DocTool
--------------

Since DocBook seems to be a lot of work to get it running on multiple platforms
I am investigating going for something simpler. Something that will
need only the standard UN*X tools to run, an ELinks doctool. This tool will be
build upon some achitecture similar to help2doc currently used to generate
elinks.conf(5).

The basic format will be something similar to how ELinks renders html pages and
probably inspired by AsciiDoc. We can then distribute the document source
(human readable plain text files like this one) versions with the source. Any
user can then:

	% cd doc && make htmldocs

or similar to generate a desired format. It will support translation to the
core formats: html and man. Which means it will also be used for the web pages.
With possibility to extend it with DocBook later.

One thing I'd also like to use it for is the option declarations. The current
scheme is hard to read and update. Something like:

	= Option =
	Name:	tofu.burgers.rock
	Type:	boolean
	Value:	1
	Flags:	0

or similar that could easily be translated to some options.inc would be much
better. This is however far ahead and solely my opinion.
