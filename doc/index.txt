Welcome! This is the entry point for the current humble ELinks manual.
It is by no way complete, it is not even very homogeneous and it should
be eventually superseded by a complete ELinks Book, which you can find
in the book/ subdirectory in a very prenatal stage.

There was a complete (or from a large part complete) manual for the
Links 0.82 once, you can still find it at:

	http://links.sourceforge.net/docs/manual-0.82-en/index.html

While large parts of it do not apply anymore, you may still find some
relevant information there.

You may also refer to the manual page for a very quick reference,
however little effort is done to keep it always up-to-date.
On the other hand, the built-in documentation is _always_ up-to-date.
Check the --long-help and --config-help ELinks command-line arguments.

(*) Man pages are best viewed with the man program. The easiest way to
do this is by telling the man program to look for man pages in the
doc/man directory by using the -M switch. If you are standing in the
top-level directory, you can do this by invoking the man program using:

	man -M doc/man elinks.conf

(**) By internal scripting, we mean scripting of the browser internals
through embedded Lua, Guile or Perl scripts. ECMAScript scripts
embedded in documents have nothing to do with that.

(***) De iure, this is not restricted to internal scripting and should
be of general interest. De facto, it is currently interesting almost
exclusively to hackers in the internal scripting area - and shall it
be very useful resource for internal scripting power users.

(****) While that file contains great deal about general source code
structure and especially guidelines regarding coding style, submitting
patches etc., thus every aspiring developer should take the pains
to read through it, do not forget to also look for README and similar
text files in the subdirectories containing the relevant sources for
detailed notes regarding given modules/subsystems.
