			Overview of the ELinks documentation

There is only limited documentation available for ELinks, sorry. It basically
consists of the documents in this directory and the features.conf, README and
INSTALL files in the project's root directory.

The files you will find in this directory are the man pages living in the man/
directory and a bunch of .html and especially .txt (wait, you expect HTML
browser to carry its documentation around in HTML?). The index.txt file
contains the table of contents listing all these files.
