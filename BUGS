Known bugs:

Key: (-) nothing done, (+) work in progress, (*) almost fixed
     (reflects only what is already committed to CVS)

Tabbed browsing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- With some opened tabs, go to freshmeat.net, when page is loaded, click on
  main menu bar to open it, then click in the center of screen, some form
  fields will be printed over current screen, but disappear on next action...

- Black (blocked) cursor appear when viewing stepping back to the initial tab
  after a second tab has been opened and ui.tabs.show_bar is on. Reproduce by
  openning www.diku.dk. Navigate to 'About DIKU' link and open it in new tab.
  Then press '<' to get back to the initial tab. A black cursor appears on the
  'n' in the document title in the tab bar.

Frame handling:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Frames don't work if there's more frames with same name. Turn them off in such
  case.

+ When a frame's src is a non-HTML file, that file is rendered as HTML.

+ In a frameset, following a link to a non-HTML file breaks out of the frames.

- Loading a page in a frame does not add that page to the global history.

Document handling:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It seems that <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;url=http://foo.com/" />
  tag is interpreted in that text file... Try to open it in ELinks.

- You can't upload large files; it takes _lots_ of memory.

Form handling:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Handling of textareas splitted to two pages is just weird.  (Is this still
  true with 0.5 CVS?)

- Go to http://www.computing.net/mac/wwwboard/forum/6268.html [;-)]
  Goto the end of page, put cursor in Image URL: field,
  then press up key, cursor will loop in some of the fields, but will never
  enter the textarea field.

Searching:
~~~~~~~~~~

- Searches match links' prefixes (when document.browse.links.numbering = 1).

- Searches do not scroll horizontally to show matched text that is beyond
  the left- or right-edge of the screen.

Links highlighting:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Spaces added by justification are not highlighted in links when those links
  are selected. The general problem is that the background is not set properly
  when the spaces are inserted.

- The 'enter' action does not cause a refresh, even when given a prefix.  Thus
  the newly selected link is not highlighted.

Misc:
~~~~~

- You shouldn't press '^Z' when you are in external program (viewer,
  editor,mailer, ...)

+ Handling of &#13; is not lynx-compatible in <pre> tag (should be newline).

- When switching between source view and rendered view, the position of the view
  is based on the page number of the previous view, not on the content of the
  previous view.

- Calling cfmakeraw() in kbd.c:setraw() breaks some exotic terminal
  combinations.

- Call to OS Shell doesn't release mouse handler.
