			README for ELusive CSS Parser

Status:
-------

Not done.

The scanners should be up and running. But the error recovering still needs
some tweeking.


Intro to the code:
------------------

The parser can be divided up into:

* scanner functions

	taking care of the lower levels of the parsing. Generating tokens.
	Skipping whitespace, comments and code snippets. The scanners do not
	attempt to recover from parsing errors but will merely signal them to
	the upper layers.

* parser functions

	taking care of the upper layers of the parsing. Structuring tokens
	(generated by the scanners). Starting recovery when something
	unexpected shows up. Also building the syntax tree.

Apart from that they act the same way and have the same interface.
