Enhanced/Extended Links (ELinks)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW browser), with more liberal
features policy and development style.

This is the ELinks tree - intended to provide feature-rich version of Links.
Its purpuose is to make alternative to Links, and to test and tune various new
features, but still provide good rock-solid releases inside stable branches.

See the manpage for detailed description of ELinks and its features.  If you are
more interested, you can examine Links website at http://links.sf.net/. For new
Links/ELinks versions announcements and bug reports, please see links-list
mailing list at linuxfromscratch.org.  If you have any feature request or hint
for developers, please post it at links-discuss mailing list at the same place.

The ELinks site with some basic information is available at
http://elinks.or.cz/. Please see SITES file for mirrors or other recommended
sites. If you want even to install ELinks on your computer, see
INSTALL file for instructions.

Why not contribute to Links instead? Well, first I made a bunch of patches for
original Links, but significant number of them got refused, because Mikulas did
not like them, as he just wouldn't have use for them himself. He wants to keep
Links with relatively closed feature set and merge only new features which he
itself needs. It has advantages that the tree is very narrow and the code is
small and only very little bloated. ELinks, on the contrary, aims to provide
full-featured web browser, superior to both lynx and w3m and with possibilites
of konqueror and similiar browser. However, to prevent drastical bloating of the
code, the development is driven in the course of modularization and separation
of add-on modules (like cookies, bookmarks, ssl, lua etc).

If you want to write some patches, please read the HACKING document.
If you want to add a new language, please read intl/README document.
If you want to write some documentation, well you're welcomed ;)
If you want to request features, report bugs, use the mailing list as mentionned
above, or come and see us on irc.openprojects.net #elinks.
