	The syntax of the config file is very simple. The elinks.conf file is
	a free-form ASCII text file. The file may contain extra tabs and
	newlines for formatting purposes. Keywords in the file are
	case-sensitive. Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except
	within quotes). Comments begin with the # character and end at the end
	of the line.
