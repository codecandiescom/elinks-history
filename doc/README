		Few words about documentation for ELinks

There is only limited documentation available for ELinks, sorry. It basically
consists of the documents in this directory and the manpages + README/INSTALL
files in the project's root directory.

Other things you will find in this directory are:

	book/ -	Where development on moving existing documentation to docbook
		format goes on.

	man/  -	The place where manpages will be moved to once they are
		integrated from doc/book/manpages.

	html/ - Will (in the future) contain processed docbook documents.
		Manual pages and man pages should be already processed.

If you'd like to contribute please read book/README.
