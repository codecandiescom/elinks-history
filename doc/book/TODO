			ELinks manual TODO list

Processing stuff:
-----------------

* Write processing (multiplexor) script.
	This should probably only test/use the db2*, docbook2* and xmlto
	wrappers. Calling jade, saxon or xsltproc directly would complicate
	things a lot.

* Write validation script (using nsgml. Others?)

* Make sane rules for Makefile.am

General manual mangling:
------------------------

* Find a sane order of the chapters/appendixes.

* Make stylesheet for html processing.
	This should set options to either not break up (chunk) chapters at all
	or so that all sections are on separate pages.

Suggestions for sections or chapter:
------------------------------------

* Overview/introduction to essential managers

* FAQ ?

* Tips/cheats ;)

* Info about deficiencies in implementations.
	Mainly to inform users about lack of security. SSL Certificate
	verification come to mind.
