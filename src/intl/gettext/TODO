* Remove plural.c from CVS.

* Use terminal-specific charset.

* Use our own charset routines instead of iconv.

* Don't require make install in order to have ELinks using the updated
  translation - it should be able to use them even when they are in the source
  tree and ELinks is there yet as well.

* Make it possible to include the translations directly in the ELinks binary.

* Maybe some portability fixes...?
