This is the ELusive project, sub-project of the ELinks project. Here, we aim
to rewrite the ELinks HTML engine in a sane way ;-).

The problem is, that now it's all very messy and chaotic. We randomly jump
around over the document source, skipping various parts and interpreting
others, etc etc.  This is ugly. We should ONCE pass thru the whole file and
parse it (and don't mix parser and renderer in one file), store the syntactic
tree and then walk thru it. Sure that it'll be a bit more tricky as we won't
know the whole document source at once frequently, but this is doable.

See TODO file for TODO list.

See DESIGN file for architecture and structure of the ELusive engine.

Note that ELusive is licenced DIFFERENTLY than ELinks, please see the LICENCE
file for details about ELusive licencing! In Bugzilla bug 50, the original HTML
engine authors agreed to relicence their stuff under ELusive licence, thus the
code may flow by both sides regarding this particular ELinks part. The only
exception is code by Flemming Framdsen, who did not acknowledge relicencing of
his code (that is mainly support for accesskey and tabindex).
