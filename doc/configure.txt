Detailled information about some configure options:

--enable-debug:

Assertions are evaluated and will core dump on failure.
Some extra sanity checks are done, and some errors will cause coredump
instead of just a message.
Internal memory leak detection is activated (memory usage will grow), and every
allocation/reallocation/free operations will be slower due to extra tests.
Lists sanity checks are enabled, so list operations are slower.
Hotkey debugging is enabled, it highlights redundant hotkeys in a menu.
This option should be _always_ used by beta testers and developpers, it helps
to detect many issues.
Binary packages maintainers should not use this option in normal situation.


--enable-fastmem:
It disables all assertions tests.
It disables all sanity checks (memory, lists, ...).
It disables internal memory allocation routines, directly calling libc
functions (so it's much faster, but memory allocation issues and memory leaks
will be not detected).
It defines fmem_alloc(), and fmem_free() to be in fact alloca() and nothing,
providing much faster allocations in routines where they are used
(developpers: be sure to understand differences between alloca() and malloc()
before any use.)
This option provides a way to generate a faster and smaller binary of a
_stable_ version of ELinks. Please do not use it with unstable releases (but
if memory footprint, performance and/or binary size are major issues for you).
