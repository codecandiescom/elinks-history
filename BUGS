Known bugs:

	Tilde doesn't expand as it should when used in goto dialog, ~ -> /home
	and ~/ -> current directory.
	
	Frames don't work if there's more frames with same name. Turn them off
in such case.

	You can't upload large files; it takes _lots_ of memory.

	You shouldn't press '^Z' when you are in a viewer

	Handling of &#13; is not lynx-compatible in <pre> tag (should be
newline).

	Tags inside <XMP> are still interpreted.

	When switching between source view and rendered view, the position of
the view is based on the page number of the previous view, not on the content of
the previous view.

	Calling cfmakeraw() in kbd.c:setraw() breaks some exotic terminal
combinations.

	When title/status bar is turned off, there's still a blank line on
top/bottom of screen.

	Handling of textareas splitted to two pages is just weird.

	Call to OS Shell doesn't release mouse handler.
