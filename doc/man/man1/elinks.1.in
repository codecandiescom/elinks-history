.SH NAME
elinks \- lynx-like alternative character mode WWW browser
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBelinks\fR [ \fBoptions\fR ] \fBurl\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ELinks is a text mode WWW browser, supporting colors,
table rendering, background downloading, menu driven
configuration interface, tabbed browsing and slim code. 
.PP
Frames are supported. You can have different file formats associated
with external viewers. mailto: and telnet: are supported via external
clients. 
.PP
ELinks can handle local (file://) or remote
(http://, ftp:// or
https:// if there's compiled-in SSL support) URLs.
It has also basic support for finger:. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Most options can be set in the user interface or config file, so
usually you do not need to care about them. Note that this list is by
no means complete and it is not kept up-to-date. To get complete list
of commandline options, start ELinks with parameter
\fI--help\fR.
.TP
\fB -anonymous <0>/<1> \fR
Restrict ELinks so that it can run on an anonymous account. No local
file browsing. No downloads. Executing of viewers is allowed, but user
can't add or modify entries in association table.
.TP
\fB -auto-submit <0>/<1> \fR
Go and submit the first form you'll stumble upon.
.TP
\fB -base-session <number> \fR
ID of session (ELinks instance) which we want to clone. This is
internal ELinks option, you don't want to use it.
.TP
\fB -config-help \fR
Print descriptions for configuration options and exit. Intended mostly
for generating documentation.
.TP
\fB -dump \fR
Write a plain-text version of the given HTML document to stdout.
.TP
\fB -dump-charset <charset> \fR
Codepage used in dump output.
.TP
\fB -dump-width <width> \fR
Width of the dump output.
.TP
\fB -eval <string> \fR
Specify \fIelinks.conf\fR configuration options on the
command-line:
\fB-eval 'set protocol.file.allow_special_files = 1'\fR
.TP
\fB -?, -h, -help \fR
Print usage help and exit.
.TP
\fB -long-help \fR
Print detailed usage help and exit.
.TP
\fB -lookup <hostname> \fR
Make lookup for specified host.
.TP
\fB -no-connect <0>/<1> \fR
Run ELinks as a separate instance - instead of connecting to existing
instance. Note that normally no runtime state files (bookmarks, history
and so on) are written to the disk with this option on - see also
\fI-touch-files\fR.
.TP
\fB -no-home <0>/<1> \fR
Don't attempt to create and/or use home configuration directory
(\fI~/.elinks\fR).
.TP
\fB -session-ring <number> \fR
ID of session ring this ELinks should connect to. The ELinks works in
so-called session rings, where all instances of ELinks are
interconnected and share same state (cache, bookmarks, cookies and so
on).  By default, all ELinks instances connect to session ring 0. You
can change that behaviour by this switch and form as many session rings
as you want.  Obviously, if the session-ring with this number doesn't
exist yet, it's created and this ELinks instance will become the master
instance (that usually doesn't matter for you as a user much). Note
that you usually don't want to use this except you're a developer and
you want to do some testing - if you want the ELinks instances running
each one standalone, rather use \fI-no-connect\fR
commandline option. Also note that normally no runtime state files are
written to the disk with this option on - see also
\fI-touch-files\fR. 
.TP
\fB -source <0>/<1> \fR
Write the given HTML document in source form to
\fIstdout\fR.
.TP
\fB -stdin <0>/<1> \fR
Open \fIstdin\fR as HTML document - it is fully
equivalent to:
\fB-eval 'set protocol.file.allow_special_files = 1'
file:///dev/stdin\fR
Use whichever suits you more ;-). Note that reading document from
\fIstdin\fR \fBWORKS ONLY WHEN YOU USE\fR
\fI-dump\fR \fBOR\fR
\fI-source\fR!! (I would like to know why you would use
\fB-source -stdin\fR, though ;-)
.TP
\fB -touch-files <0>/<1> \fR
Set to 1 to have runtime state files (bookmarks, history, ...) changed
even when \fI-no-connect\fR is used; has no effect if
not used in connection with the \fI-no-connect\fR
commandline option.
.TP
\fB -version \fR
Print ELinks version information and exit.
