We should add also support for:

* cryptlib (http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/ - it is distributed
 in zip form which doesn't look very business-like, and it lacks manual in a
 format conviently readable for me; however, they say it is damn fast and very
 easy to use)

* NSS (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ - it could be pretty
 widespread and nicely tested by mozilla, however it scares me, it looks to be
 pretty complex and already needing some certificates db generated etc)
