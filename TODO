TODO list for ELinks (mostly unsorted):


Major goals:

+ Rewrite HTML parser (see ELusive)

- EcmaScript (http://home.worldcom.ch/~jmlugrin/fesi/)

- Then, support for proxy autoconfiguration
  (http://www.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html)

- Graphics support

- Possibility to optionally use commandline-driven interface instead of BFU

- Generalised scripting interface, possibly also supporting SWIG backend
  (http://www.swig.org/)

+ Reorganization of user interface


Minor first-level goals:

- Show all downloads in one window, kind of "download manager"

- Forward/backward history manager

- Cookie manager

- Disk cache


ELusive:

See src/elusive/TODO.


Original HTML engine:

- Better support for vlink - we have to update already rendered document

- Support nested <sub>script tags. Maybe use parentheses to disambiguate
  superscript?


Text HTML viewer:

- Display links to or with images with a distinct colour

- Allow resizing of frames

- Alert user when he attempts to follow a broken link to a fragment on the
  current page

- Include search string in 'Search string not found' error box

- Incremental-search

- Configurable highlight colour for text matched after a search


User interface / terminal stuff:

- Use terminfo instead of hardwired ANSI control sequences

- Show certain information specified with <meta> and <link> tags in the
  Document Info box

- Kill-ring for edit-boxes

- Show selected link's title (which is specified by the title attribute) in the
  statusbar

- Support using the hardstatus line to display current page's title, URL, or
  whatever

- Use the alternate screen (terminfo capabilities smcup and rmcup) in XTerms
  and GNU Screen

- Insert should toggle insert/overwrite mode.

- Copy URL to X clipboard (using X selections).


Generic listboxes:

- 'Search' in the bookmark mgr. should be able to search collapsed folders

- Expand or collapse recursively and expand or collapse all folders in
  hierarchical listboxes

- Highlight marked listbox items instead of or in addition to putting asterisks
  next to them


Bookmarks:

- Sessions: Bookmark the current page of each tab or window under a single
  folder.

- Complementary 'open all bookmarks in folder' or 'open all marked bookmarks'
  buttons in the bookmark mgr.

- Support for bookmarked-link colour in addition to visited-link colour


Global history:

+ Show any info that can be found in globhist for the selected link in the Info
  box


Options / keybindings / runtime configuration:

- Improve keybinding so that it works more universally

- Mouse buttonbinding ;)

- Support prefixes for more bindings; candidates: goto-url-current-link,
  add-bookmark-link, back, unback, document-info, next-frame, previous-frame,
  tab-prev, tab-next, tab-close, zoom-frame


Downloads / scheduling:

- Allow multiple transfers to be queued up instead of cancelling the currently
  queued item when back is pressed

- When calling external viewer on files, assign temporary files the suffix
  appropriate to the file type (?)

- Passing URL to external command (possibly make alt+[0-9] to pass current link
  to external command (?)).

- Bandwidth limiter for file downloads.


MIME / mailcap:

- Allow the output from MIME handlers to be displayed in ELinks


Protocols / network:

- HTTPS proxy support (!) (I have no idea how to do it so someone else will
  have to; good job for a wannabe ELinks developer ;)


Scripting:

- Add Lua APIs to manipulate bookmarks and other things


Generic code changes:

- Change msg_box to use printf-style formats

- Optimize multiple _()s of the same strings by using temporary variables


Build-time configuration / build:

+ Some rules for sane handling of texinfo documentation


Permanent goals:

+ General code cleanup

+ Write some more documentation.. docs, a lot of docs!

+ Speed optimizations


Key: - nothing done + work in progress * almost ready
     (reflects only what is already committed to CVS)
