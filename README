Experimental Links (elinks)
Development version of Lynx-like text WWW browser.

This is the elinks tree - intended to provide feature-rich version of links,
however not rock-stable and dedicated mainly for testing.  Its purpuose is to
make alternative to links, until Mikulas will have some time to maintain it, and
to test and tune various patches for Mikulas to be able to include them in the
official links releases.

See the manpage for detailed description of elinks and its features.  If you are
interested more, you can examine links website at http://links.sf.net/. For new
links/elinks versions announcements and bug reports, please see links-list
mailing list at linuxfromscratch.org.  If you have any feature request or hint
for developers, please post it at links-discuss mailing list at the same place.

The elinks site with some basic information is available at
http://pasky.ji.cz/elinks/. Please see SITES file for mirrors or other
recommended sites. If you want even to install elinks on your computer, see
INSTALL file for instructions.
