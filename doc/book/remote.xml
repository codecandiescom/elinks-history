<section title="Managing remote ELinks instances with -remote">
<t>

	Some programs provide the ability to pass URIs to external
	programs.  When stumbling upon a reference to a page you want to
	see, it is sometimes a kludge to copy and paste it into ELinks.
	This is where -remote can be a nifty solution.

</t>
<t>

	When invoking ELinks with the -remote argument, it does not
	start a new instance, but instead connects to an already running
	ELinks, making it possible to control that ELinks instance. The
	-remote command line switch takes a command consisting of the
	action to invoke and any parameters to the action.  Here is an
	example for opening freshmeat.net in a new tab:

</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
	$ elinks -remote "openURL(http://freshmeat.net/, new-tab)"
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>

	When running this command in a terminal, you will see a small
	delay before ELinks returns. If no running instance was found,
	it will return with the error message:

</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
	ELinks: No remote session to connect to.
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>

	All URLs passed to the openURL() commands can be URL prefixes,
	so the command above could have simply used ``openURL(fm,
	new-tab)''.

</t>

<section title="Limitations and outstanding issues">
<t>

	Remote control is implemented using the intercommunication
	socket created in ~/.elinks/, so the command has to be run on
	the same machine as the instance you want to control; or put
	differently: the two ELinkses need to share a file system that
	supports socket files, which rules out usage of -remote over
	NFS.  This also implies that the ELinks instance you want to
	control should be started without passing -no-home nor
	-no-connect.

</t>
<t>

	The built-in -remote support is to some degree compatible with
	the one Mozilla provides
	(http://www.mozilla.org/unix/remote.html), but with some
	homebrew extensions added and few unsupported features. All the
	supported actions are documented below.

</t>
<t>

	Under some circumstances, use of the -remote control can cause
	ELinks to become unresponsive. This is cause by the current key
	press and mouse focus being redirected to new tabs or dialogs
	opened by the -remote action.

	The command syntax is case-insensitive. For readability, we use
	the casing in the listing of supported commands.

</t>
<t>

	Mozilla -remote compatible commands:

</t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="ping():">

	Checks for existence of a remote instance. Makes it possible for
	scripts to query if remote controlling is possible.

</t>
<t hangText="openURL():">

	Prompts for a URL in current tab by opening the Goto dialog.

</t>
<t hangText="openURL(URL):">

	Open the passed URL in current tab.

</t>
<t hangText="openURL(URL, new-tab):">

	Opens the passed URL in new tab.

</t>
<t hangText="openURL(URL, new-window):">

	Opens the passed URL in new window.

</t>
<t hangText="xfeDoCommand(openBrowser):">

	Opens an ELinks instance in a new window. This ELinks instance
	will connect to the already running one.

</t>
</list>
<t>

	ELinks extensions:

</t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="addBookmark(URL):">

	Bookmarks the passed URL.

</t>
</list>
<t>

	-remote can also take a list of URLs without an explicit action,
	in which case the URL arguments will be opened in new tabs in
	the remote instance. For example, by running:

</t>
<t>

	$ elinks -remote slashdot.org fm g:elinks

</t>
<t>

	new tabs containing slashdot.org, freshmeat.net and a Google
	search of elinks will be opened.
