			Introduction to the World of ELinks

The goal of this introduction is to explain the basic concepts in ELinks, give
an overview of how to get started and serve as an entry point to many of the
(undocumented) features of ELinks. It won't tell you all the details, but
should hopefully give you an idea of how things work and make it possible for
you to even figure out how to go further.

Allthough ELinks is text-based, the user interface has many of interaction
methods normally found in graphical environments. There are menus, dialogs
with buttons and hierarchic list boxes with folders. Care has been taken to
make the interaction between various dialogs consistent, so the controls will
quickly become familiar to new users.

The user interface can be controlled using both mouse and keyboard, but
currently it is only possible to configure keybindings. Looking back, the
key-controls have been more advanced than the mouse support, but during the
0.10 prereleases the mouse support has been much improved. You will now find
find stuff like contextual menus when right-clicking in different document
zones.


Overview of the User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main user interface of ELinks consists of the document view and dialog
bars displaying the information such as the title of the currently viewed
document, all opened tabs and the browsing status. The 3 bars are elaborated
further below.

The most important dialogs, that you will meet, include the Main, Link and Tab
menus and the different managers. The menus serve as entry points to the
actions available from different contexts, while the managers let you check
the state and control the various subsystems, such as loaded cookies and the
global history. The utility menus and the manager tools are investigated
further below.

The document viewer in ELinks provides a feature-rich set of ways to browse
documents. That is, multiple options exist for navigating, searching and
displaying documents and you will hopefully figure in time what works best for
you. The basic browsing possibilities are presented below.

ELinks is highly configurable, so if there is something that you would like to
change it is most likely possible. The best overview of the many options are
given in the elinks.conf(5) man page. Keybindings are discussed in the
elinkskeys(5) man page. It is not always up-to-date, so you should also check
the keybinding manager and the overview of all the configured keybindings
given in the Help -> Keys dialog. The Keys dialogs serves as a good
introduction to the most common keybindings.


The Title, Tab and Status bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The title bars main purpose is to display the title of the current document.
Documents bigger than can be displayed with the current screen size are
divided into subpages. In this case the current document position is indicated
in the far right of the title bar as a suffix to the actual document title.
The syntax is: ( <current subpage> / <number of subpages> ), an example is
"(4/9)" that indicates the 4th subpage of 9 subpages.

The tab bar by default is only visible when 2 or more tabs are open. It is
divided into slots containing the trimmed title of the tabs loaded document.
Between each tab is a separator. The current tab is highlighted and all
tabs that has not been viewed after being loaded are highlighted as fresh.
Tabs are explained in details in the tabs.txt file.

The status bar has multiple purposes. Most of the time it will contain the URI
(and title) of the currently selected link. If a link is followed connection
information is shown in the status bar. When using cursor routing the status
bar will show the coordinates of the cursor when a link is not followed.


The Main, Link and Tab Menus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Main Menu gives you access to many of the features of ELinks via submenus
and serves as a good entry point for performing actions on the different
objects of interest such as links, documents and tabs. The Link menu and Tab
menus are more specialized and targeted to a specific context, such as link
handling or managing the tab bar. Actually the Link Menu is accessible from
the Main Menu as a submenu.

Once you have familiarized yourself with the menus you will have a good chance
at gradually learning the most common keybinding, since all the configured
keybindings are shown as right aligned text. Menu entries can also be quickly
accessed using hotkeys. Hotkeys appear highlighted in the menu entry text. For
example the key-combo: "<Alt>-v i" will open the document info dialog
accessible from the View sub menu in the Main menu.


The Managers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The managers let you control the state of subsystems, such as cookies and the
global history. They are accessible from the Tools or Setup submenu in the
Main Menu. The managers consists of an area showing a hierarchy of boxes and
buttons at the bottom. Below a view of the cookie manager is shown.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The hierarchic boxes are either folders or leafs. Folder boxes are displayed
with a "[-]" or "[+]" before the name telling whether the folder is currently
open or closed. Nested boxes are displayed indented compared to the folder
they are nested in. In the cookie manager example above "bjork.com" is a
folder box and "PREF" is a leaf box.

Boxes can be "marked", which makes it possible to select a group of boxes and
perform an action on them, such as deleting all marked boxes. If any box has
been marked the currently selected box is ignored when performing the action.
Marked boxes are displayed with an asterics ('*') prefixing the name.

The buttons make it possible to perform actions either on selected or marked
boxes or on all boxes in the manager. Buttons named "Clear" and "Save" are
performed on all boxes; "Clear" will delete all boxes and "Save" will update
the runtime state file associated with the manager in the ~/.elinks/
directory. Most buttons presses will query you before completing the action.

At any time both the currently selected box and button are highlighted. The
same goes for marked boxes. Most manager dialogs also maintains the state, so
that when you reopen the manager later it will have the same box selected and
the same folders opened or closed.

The basic default controls for managers are the following:

	Up/Down		Select the box above/below.
	'*'		Toggle marking of a box.
	Space		Open and close folders.
	Left/Right	Select the button to the left/right.
	Enter		Press the currently selected button.
	Esc		Close the manager dialog.

Some managers also supports searching, either by pressing the "[ Search ]"
button or by pressing '/'. By searching the empty string all hidden boxes from
the previous search will be shown again.

Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~

ELinks provides various ways to navigate documents. Depending on how documents
are structured it can be a great help to change navigation style. The
navigation styles can roughly be divided into page-oriented, link-oriented and
screen-oriented. They overlap in many ways, so this separation is mostly used
as a mean to present them.

Page Oriented Navigation:

	This involves scrolling documents horizontally and vertically.
	Documents can be scrolled page-wise, where the next or previous
	subpage will be displayed. It is also possible to scroll documents in
	steps, either line-wise (vertically) or column-wise (horizontally).
	The step size can be configured and by default is 2 lines and 8
	columns. Alternatively whole documents can be scrolled to the start
	or the end.

	The basic default controls:

		Insert/Delete	Scroll up/down line-wise. (vertically)
		PageUp/PageDown	Scroll up/down page-wise.
		'['/']'		Scroll left/right column-wise. (horizontally)
		Home/End	Scroll to the start/end of the document.

Link Oriented Navigation:

	For hypertext documents, access to the links makes it more practical
	to navigate by jumping between links in the document. There are two
	ways to do this; either you can move between links relationally or by
	number. Using relational link navigation it is possible to focus the
	next/previous link or move in a directional manner to the link in a
	certain direction such as left/right/up/down.

	In order to navigate using link numbers you have to first toggle link
	numbering on. This will prefix all links with a number using the
	notation [<number>]. "[23]" indicates link number 23. When link
	numbering is enabled pressing any number key will pop up a "Go to
	link"-dialog where the complete link number can be entered. By
	pressing Enter the entered link number will be focused, but only if it
	is a valid link number.

	Note: it is also possible to jump to links by searching the link text.
	Check the documentation on searching.

	The basic default controls:

		Up/Down		Move to the previous/next link.
		'.'		Toggle link numbering.
		Enter/Right	Follow the current focused link.

		No keys are by default configured for directional link
		navigation.

Position Oriented Navigation:

	Positional navigation (sorry, bad word) uses the either the position
	of the cursor or the mouse click to navigate the document. If you are
	familiar with the w3m text-browser you will be familiar with cursor
	routing. Basicly you move the cursor around -- kind of like a mouse --
	in the document area of the user interface. When the cursor is over a
	link the link is highlighted and when the cursor moves outside the
	current document view it will cause the document view to scroll.

	The possibilities when using the mouse to navigate document depend on
	what terminal you are using. In some terminals it is possible to
	scroll by using the mouse wheel. Scrolling is however also possible by
	clicking in the edge areas of the document view. High-lighting links
	can be done by clicking on a link but waiting to release the mouse
	button until the link is no longer under the mouse pointer.

	No keys are by default configured for cursor routing.


Note: This is still a work in progress and from here on an below everything is
marked TODO!

Searching
~~~~~~~~~

 - Text searching using the normal search dialog

 - Incremental document text searching

 - Link searching


Hints and Odd Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Numerical action prefixes. Example 3<Down> jumps down three links.

 - How to move forward in the document history ('u').

Useful Document Display Options:

 - Toggling color modes, plain/html and image link rendering.

 - Link numbering.
