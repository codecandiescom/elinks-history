Preface
-------

Welcome! This is the entry point for the current humble ELinks manual.  It
is by no way complete, it is not even very homogeneous and it should be
eventually superseded by a complete ELinks Book.

There was a complete (or from a large part complete) manual for the Links
0.82 once, you can still find it at:

	http://links.sourceforge.net/docs/manual-0.82-en/index.html

While large parts of it do not apply anymore, you may still find some
relevant information there.

Hold harmless the authors, and any lawful use is allowed.
