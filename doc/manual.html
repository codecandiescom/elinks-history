<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>

	Welcome! This is the entry point for the current humble ELinks
	manual.  It is by no way complete, it is not even very
	homogeneous and it should be eventually superseded by a complete
	ELinks Book, which you can find in the book/ subdirectory in a
	very prenatal stage.


</p>
<p>

	There was a complete (or from a large part complete) manual for
	the Links 0.82 once, you can still find it at:

	<a href="http://links.sourceforge.net/docs/manual-0.82-en/index.html">http://links.sourceforge.net/docs/manual-0.82-en/index.html</a>

	While large parts of it do not apply anymore, you may still find
	some relevant information there.


</p>
<p>

	You may also refer to the manual page for a very quick
	reference, however little effort is done to keep it always
	up-to-date.  On the other hand, the built-in documentation is
	_always_ up-to-date.  Check the --long-help and --config-help
	ELinks command-line arguments.


</p>
<p>

	Hold harmless the author, and any lawful use is allowed.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;Introduction to the World of ELinks</h3>

<p>

	The goal of this introduction is to explain the basic concepts
	in ELinks, give an overview of how to get started and serve as
	an entry point to many of the (undocumented) features of ELinks.
	It won't tell you all the details, but should hopefully give you
	an idea of how things work and make it possible for you to even
	figure out how to go further.


</p>
<p>

	Allthough ELinks is text-based, the user interface has many of
	interaction methods normally found in graphical environments.
	There are menus, dialogs with buttons and hierarchic list boxes
	with folders. Care has been taken to make the interaction
	between various dialogs consistent, so the controls will quickly
	become familiar to new users.


</p>
<p>

	The user interface can be controlled using both mouse and
	keyboard, but currently it is only possible to configure
	keybindings. Looking back, the key-controls have been more
	advanced than the mouse support, but during the 0.10 prereleases
	the mouse support has been much improved. You will now find find
	stuff like contextual menus when right-clicking in different
	document zones.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor2">1.1</a>&nbsp;Overview of the User Interface</h4>

<p>

	The main user interface of ELinks consists of the document view
	and dialog bars displaying the information such as the title of
	the currently viewed document, all opened tabs and the browsing
	status. The 3 bars are elaborated further below.


</p>
<p>

	The most important dialogs that you will meet include the Main,
	Link and Tab menus and the different managers. The menus serve
	as entry points to the actions available from different
	contexts, while the managers let you check the state and control
	the various subsystems, such as loaded cookies and the global
	history. The utility menus and the manager tools are
	investigated further below.


</p>
<p>

	The document viewer in ELinks provides a feature-rich set of
	ways to browse documents. That is, multiple options exist for
	navigating, searching and displaying documents and you will
	hopefully figure in time what works best for you. The basic
	browsing possibilities are presented below.


</p>
<p>

	ELinks is highly configurable, so if there is something that you
	would like to change, it is most likely possible. The best
	overview of the many options are given in the elinks.conf(5) man
	page. Keybindings are discussed in the elinkskeys(5) man page.
	It is not always up-to-date, so you should also check the
	keybinding manager and the overview of all the configured
	keybindings given in the Help -> Keys dialog. The Keys dialogs
	serves as a good introduction to the most common keybindings.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor3">1.2</a>&nbsp;The Title, Tab and Status bar</h4>

<p>

	The title bars main purpose is to display the title of the
	current document.  Documents bigger than can be displayed with
	the current screen size are divided into subpages. In this case
	the current document position is indicated in the far right of
	the title bar as a suffix to the actual document title.  The
	syntax is: ( current-subpage / total-subpages ), an example is
	"(4/9)" that indicates the 4th subpage of 9 subpages.


</p>
<p>

	The tab bar by default is only visible when 2 or more tabs are
	open. It is divided into slots containing the trimmed title of
	the tabs' loaded document.  Between each tab is a separator. The
	current tab is highlighted and all tabs that has not been viewed
	after being loaded are highlighted as fresh.  Tabs are explained
	in details in the tabs.txt file.


</p>
<p>

	The status bar has multiple purposes. Most of the time it will
	contain the URI (and title) of the currently selected link. If a
	link is followed, connection information is shown in the status
	bar. When using cursor routing, the status bar will show the
	coordinates of the cursor when a link is not followed.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor4">1.3</a>&nbsp;The Main, Link and Tab Menus</h4>

<p>

	The Main Menu gives you access to many of the features of ELinks
	via submenus and serves as a good entry point for performing
	actions on the different objects of interest, such as links,
	documents and tabs. The Link menu and Tab menus are more
	specialized and targeted to a specific context, such as link
	handling or managing the tab bar. Actually, the Link Menu is
	accessible from the Main Menu as a submenu.


</p>
<p>

	Once you have familiarized yourself with the menus, you will
	have a good chance at gradually learning the most common
	keybinding, since all the configured keybindings are shown as
	right aligned text. Menu entries can also be quickly accessed
	using hotkeys. Hotkeys appear highlighted in the menu entry
	text. For example the key-combo "Alt-v i" will open the document
	info dialog accessible from the View sub menu in the Main menu.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor5">1.4</a>&nbsp;The Managers</h4>

<p>

	The managers let you control the state of subsystems, such as
	cookies and the global history. They are accessible from the
	Tools or Setup submenu in the Main Menu. The managers consists
	of an area showing a hierarchic listbox and buttons at the
	bottom. Below, a view of the cookie manager is shown.

|   [ Info ]  [ Add ]  [ Edit ]  [ Delete ]  [ Save ]  [ Close ]   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+</pre>

<p>

	Each item is either a folder or a leaf. A folder is displayed
	with a "[-]" or "[+]" before the name telling whether the folder
	is currently open or closed. Nested items are displayed indented
	compared to the folder they are nested in. In the cookie manager
	example above "bjork.com" is a folder and "PREF" is a leaf.


</p>
<p>

	Items can be "marked", which makes it possible to select a group
	of items and perform an action on them, such as deleting all
	marked items. If any item has been marked the currently selected
	item is ignored when performing the action.  Marked items are
	displayed with an asterics ('*') prefixing the name.


</p>
<p>

	The buttons make it possible to perform actions either on
	selected or marked items or on all items in the manager. Buttons
	named "Clear" and "Save" are performed on all items; "Clear"
	will delete all items and "Save" will update the runtime state
	file associated with the manager in the ~/.elinks/ directory.
	Most buttons presses will query you before completing the
	action.


</p>
<p>

	At any time, both the currently selected item and button are
	highlighted. The same goes for marked items. Most manager
	dialogs also maintains the state, so that when you reopen the
	manager later it will have the same items selected and the same
	folders opened or closed.


</p>
<p>
	
	The basic default controls for managers are the following:


</p><table class="data" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="30%">Keys</th>
<th align="left" width="70%">Action</th>

	Some managers also supports searching, either by pressing the "[
	Search ]" button or by pressing '/'. By searching the empty
	string, all hidden items from the previous search will be shown
	again.

<a name="rfc.section.1.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor6">1.5</a>&nbsp;Navigation</h4>

<p>

	ELinks provides various ways to navigate documents. Depending on
	how documents are structured, it can be a great help to change
	navigation style. The navigation styles can roughly be divided
	into page-oriented, link-oriented and screen-oriented. They
	overlap in many ways, so this separation is mostly used as a
	mean to present them.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.5.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor7">1.5.1</a>&nbsp;Page-Oriented Navigation</h4>

<p>

	This involves scrolling documents horizontally and vertically.
	Documents can be scrolled page-wise, where the next or previous
	subpage will be displayed. It is also possible to scroll documents in
	steps, either line-wise (vertically) or column-wise (horizontally).
	The step size can be configured and by default is 2 lines and 8
	columns. Alternatively, whole documents can be scrolled to the start
	or the end.


</p>
<p>
	
	The basic default controls:


</p><table class="data" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="30%">Keys</th>
<th align="left" width="70%">Action</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Insert/Delete</td>
<td align="left">Scroll up/down line-wise. (vertically)</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p>
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.5.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor8">1.5.2</a>&nbsp;Link-Oriented Navigation</h4>

<p>

	For hypertext documents, access to the links makes it more practical
	to navigate by jumping between links in the document. There are two
	ways to do this; either you can move between links relationally or by
	number. Using relational link navigation it is possible to focus the
	next/previous link or move in a directional manner to the link in a
	certain direction such as left/right/up/down.


</p>
<p>

	In order to navigate using link numbers, you have to first toggle link
	numbering on; this will prefix all links with a number using the
	notation [number]. "[23]" indicates link number 23. When link
	numbering is enabled, pressing any number key will pop up a "Go to
	link"-dialog where the complete link number can be entered. By
	pressing Enter the entered link number will be focused, but only if it
	is a valid link number.


</p>
<p>

	Note: it is also possible to jump to links by searching the link text;
	check the documentation on searching.


</p>
<p>
	
	The basic default controls:


</p><table class="data" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="30%">Keys</th>
<th align="left" width="70%">Action</th>
</tr>

<td align="left">Move to the previous/next link.</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">'.'</td>
<td align="left">Toggle link numbering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Enter/Right</td>
<td align="left">Follow the current focused link.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>

	No keys are by default configured for directional link
	navigation.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.5.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor9">1.5.3</a>&nbsp;Position-Oriented Navigation</h4>

<p>

	Positional navigation (sorry, bad word) uses the either the position
	of the cursor or the mouse click to navigate the document. If you are
	familiar with the w3m text-browser you will be familiar with cursor
	routing. Basicly, you move the cursor around -- kind of like a mouse --
	in the document area of the user interface. When the cursor is over a
	link, the link is highlighted, and when the cursor moves outside the
	current document view, it will cause the document view to scroll.


</p>
<p>

	The possibilities when using the mouse to navigate the document depend on
	what terminal you are using. In some terminals, it is possible to
	scroll by using the mouse wheel. Scrolling is however also possible by
	clicking in the edge areas of the document view. Highlighting links
	can be done by clicking on a link but waiting to release the mouse
	button until the link is no longer under the mouse pointer.


</p>
<p>

	No keys are by default configured for cursor routing.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.1.5.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor10">1.5.4</a>&nbsp;Forms</h4>

	The status bar will indicate the type and name of the field.

</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<a name="rfc.section.1.6"></a><h4><a name="anchor11">1.6</a>&nbsp;Searching</h4>

<p>

	Searching is by default available by pressing '/'. This will
	open a search dialog with a input text field for entering the
	search terms and checkboxes to control how searching is
	performed. You can indicate whether matching should be case
	sensitive and whether regular expressions or normal searching
	should be used.


</p>
<p>

	It is also possible to make an incremental search, also called
	type-ahead searching. You can search either the whole document
	text or only link text.  The latter can be useful if you see a
	link deep inside a page and want to get to it quickly.


</p>
<p>

	Matches of the search term will be high-lighted. After having
	performed document text search all matches will be high-lighted.
	To get rid of this high-lighting you have to ``search for the
	empty string'', that is open a search dialog and just press
	Enter in the input field.


</p>
<p>

	Previous search words are saved in the search history, so they
	can easily b found and used later. Browsing the history will
	replace the current entered search terms.


</p>
<p>

	The basic default controls for searching are the following:

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;The Ultimate Bookmarks Guide</h3>

<p>

	Glad to see you again, mortal. Now, we are going to learn about
	bookmarks - how to use them, how to maintain them, and also something
	more about the file formats and maybe even about the code structure
	later. But don't fear, we won't burden you with it, just stop reading
	when you already know enough.


</p>
<p>

	In order to read this, you need some common sense, the ability to
	start ELinks and some idea about what's a Web document, a URL address
	and knowledge like that.


</p>
<p>

	If we ever mention some keys here, please note that you can rebind
	almost any action to another key which you like more - then you must
	obviously imagine your own key in place of that. Below, we will list
	all actions, options and so on related to bookmarks. We won't tell you
	how to rebind the keys, though; another document will take on that.


</p>
<p>

	Somewhat out-of-order, a very frequent FAQ: In order to move bookmarks
	around, you need to mark them first - press Insert or '*' (if you use
	the default keymap) to do that.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor14">2.1</a>&nbsp;The Bookmark Manager</h4>

<p>

	Basically, almost everything is going on in the so-called bookmark
	manager. That's a special dialog window, which contains a listing of
	all the bookmarks you ever told ELinks to remember and it lets you to
	do with them anything you would ever want to do with them.


</p>
<p>

	You launch the bookmark manager by pressing the 's' key in standby
	(standard) mode. You should see a big empty space (bookmarks will
	slowly appear there as you will add them) and couple of buttons
	shriveling at the bottom. So, as a start, move with the right (or
	left; both will do) arrow to the button "Add bookmark" and fill in the
	input fields it offers to you. I mean, you can type something like
	"ELinks homepage" to the first field, then move down by e.g.  the down
	arrow and fill "http://elinks.or.cz/" to the second field. Then,
	bravely press enter and watch the bookmark popping up at the top of
	the vast area reserved for bookmarks.


</p>
<p>

	Repeat this step few times. Now, you can move between bookmarks by the
	up and down arrow, jump to the location any of them points to by the
	Goto button, change it by the Edit button, delete it with the Delete
	button and so on. When you'll become bored, press the escape button
	and you're free again!


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor15">2.2</a>&nbsp;The Ancient Forests</h4>

<p>

	It's not very convenient to have all the bookmarks mixed up - soon,
	you will get lost in them. Thus, in ELinks you can categorize them to
	various folders, subfolders, subsubfolders and so on, then you can
	expand and back enfold them and so on.


</p>
<p>

	In order to create your first folder, use the button "Add folder" and
	fill the first input field. You can safely ignore the URL field,
	ELinks will do the same. *POOF* and you see it - it has that strange
	[+] or [-] thing there. If it has [+] near, it's enfolded, while when
	it has [-] near, it is expanded, while you can change that by pressing
	the spacebar.


</p>
<p>

	In order to add a bookmark into a folder, move on the item of the
	folder (it must be expanded) or onto any bookmark inside of the folder
	and simply do the usual "Add bookmark" job. You can also move the
	bookmarks around, obviously.  You need to first mark all the bookmarks
	(or even folders) you want to move using the Insert or '*'
	key--asterisk will appear near of all marked bookmarks--and then move
	to where you want to have the stuff moved to, and press the "Move"
	button.


</p>
<p>

	Separators can be inserted as well, using "Add separator" button, or
	by entering a special bookmark with "-" as title and no url.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor16">2.3</a>&nbsp;Searching needle in the haycock</h4>

<p>

	Of course, you can search in the bookmarks. Just use the "Find" button
	- for convenience, you have the current document's URL and title
	pre-filled there, and for convenience only up-up-enter-down-down
	sequence is enough to have the playground clean. Then, just fill a
	substring of what you are looking for, and the bookmarks will be
	filtered so that only the matching ones are shown.  (Actually,
	currently it will not be filtered but the cursor will only jump to the
	first matching bookmark below the current cursor position - and it
	will NOT wrap around. The exact behaviour changes time by time and
	hasn't been stabilized yet.)


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor17">2.4</a>&nbsp;File formats</h4>

<p>

	ELinks supports two bookmark formats: the native format and a generic
	bookmark exchange format called XBEL. Each of those formats has its
	pros and cons, which we shall discuss below. You can switch between
	then by changing the option bookmarks.file_format.


</p>
<p>

	However, first please note that ELinks CANNOT read Links bookmarks
	directly.  Importing Links-0.9x (or Links-1.x) bookmarks is easy - it
	is just matter of changing all the '|' (pipe) characters to tabs.
	There is a script for that in the contrib/conv/ directory. Importing
	Links-2.xx bookmarks is not so easy; in fact, the scribe knows of no
	way of doing that at the time of writing this, so this is up to you to
	figure out (if you do, please tell us so that we can add it here).
	Perhaps you might find a way to convert Links2 bookmarks to the XBEL
	format, which can then be loaded in ELinks.



</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.4.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor18">2.4.1</a>&nbsp;Native file format</h4>

<p>

	This is the preferred bookmarks format, which is also used by default.
	The bookmarks file is ~/.elinks/bookmarks, in a simple format:


</p><pre>
	&lt;name&gt; '\t' &lt;url&gt; [ '\t' &lt;depth&gt; ['\t' &lt;flags&gt;]] '\n'</pre>

<p>

	'\t' represents a tab character, '\n' represents a newline character.
	[Square brackets] denote optional parts. The &lt;name&gt; and
	&lt;url&gt; fields should be obvious.  &lt;depth&gt; contains the
	depth level of the entry - by that, ELinks can unambiguously figure
	out the bookmarks hierarchy:


</p>
<p>
</p><pre>
	Bookmarks structure:                                Depth:
	 ,-- The Pasky's C Bestiary                         0
	[-]- Wonderful things                               0
	 |    |-- Christmas Carol in l33tsp34k by L.M.      1
	 |   [-]- Beautiful Potato Camera Shots             1
	 |   [-]- Gallery of Scary Images of Jonas Fonseca  1
	 |         |-- Jonas torturing gdb                  2
	 |        [-]- Urgh                                 2
	 |         |    `-- Jonas consuming Tofu            3
	 |         `-- Jonas with crashed ELinks            2
	 |-- Slides from Witek's hack-patch show            0
	 `-- Miciah's English Grammar Spellbook             0</pre>

<p>

	&lt;flags&gt; is a string of characters. Currently, two flags are supported:


</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>E:</dt>
<dd>

	This folder is currently expanded. (No effect for non-folders.)


</dd>
<dt>F:</dt>
<dd>

	This entry is a folder. The &lt;url&gt; part is usually empty.


</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>

	Separators: these are special bookmarks with "-" as title and no
	url.


</p>
<p>

	Pros: Naturally, ELinks handles the native format the best,
	easiest and most reliably.


</p>
<p>

	Cons: It is unlikely that you could use the native format
	anywhere else than in ELinks.


</p>
<p>

	To use the native format, set bookmarks.file_format = 0.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.4.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor19">2.4.2</a>&nbsp;XBEL file format</h4>

<p>

	The XBEL file format support was added at some point during the
	0.4 development by Fabio Boneli. It has never been complete and
	has plenty of troubles, but generally, it works at the basic
	level. The bookmarks file is ~/.elinks/bookmarks.xbel (thanks to
	a different filename, you can have both XBEL and native
	bookmarks saved in your ~/.elinks directory).


</p>
<p>

	We shall not describe the XBEL file format here,
	
	<a href="http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/">http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/</a>

	is the authoritative resource on that. It also contains list of
	some of the applications supporting the format.  Basically, you
	will be probably able to convert from/to the XBEL format to/from
	most of the other widely used formats, so this way you can
	import your bookmarks to ELinks from basically anything.


</p>
<p>

	Pros: XBEL is the gateway to the rest of the bookmarks world.


</p>
<p>

	Cons: The support for XBEL is incomplete and there are known
	bugs. Especially, national character sets are basically not
	supported, so ELinks will most likely get it wrong if you have
	any non-ASCII characters in your bookmarks.  Generally, the XBEL
	support should be considered experimental and you shouldn't rely
	on it. It *could* trash your XBEL bookmarks file so make regular
	backups.


</p>
<p>

	To use the XBEL format, set bookmarks.file_format = 1.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.2.4.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor20">2.4.3</a>&nbsp;Usage hints</h4>

<p>

	As already noted above, probably the best usage pattern is to
	use XBEL for importing/exporting your bookmarks to/from ELinks
	and the native format for regular operation. Of course, if you
	want to synchronize your bookmarks in ELinks and some other
	XBEL-supporting gadget and you are brave, you can use XBEL as
	your exclusive bookmark format - the choice is upon you.


</p>
<p>

	Regarding the bookmarks synchronization, there is one important
	note. ELinks saves your bookmarks each time you added one
	through the 'a' shortcut (add-bookmark action) or when closing
	the bookmarks manager if you made any changes or when quitting
	ELinks. However, ELinks reads your bookmarks only _ONCE_, during
	the startup. This behaviour may change in the future (tell us if
	you need a way for ELinks to re-read the bookmarks file), but
	this is how it is done now.


</p>
<p>

	Actually, you may now ask "So how do I convert bookmarks between
	the two formats?".  It is quite easy.  ELinks simply follows the
	current value of bookmarks.file_format whenever loading/saving
	the bookmarks.


</p>
<p>

	So, e.g. if you normally use the native format but you want the
	bookmarks to be saved in the XBEL format once, change
	bookmarks.file_format to 1, then cause the bookmarks to be
	resaved (e.g. by doing some simple change, like adding a
	trailing space to some bookmark's title or so), then change the
	bookmarks.file_format value back to 0.


</p>
<p>

	It is a little more complicated if you normally use the native
	format but you want to import bookmarks from the XBEL format
	once. You again change bookmarks.file_format to 1, then cause
	the bookmarks to be reloaded.  That involves saving the
	configuration, quitting ELinks _completely_ (that means
	closing/killing all instances of it you have running), then
	restarting it and changing bookmarks.file_format to 0. Then save
	the configuration again and cause ELinks to resave the
	bookmarks.


</p>
<p>

	Agreed, this all strange dances are quite clumsy, likely some
	simple wizard-like interface for switching the bookmarks formats
	will be introduced in the future. So far, we have had no reports
	from our users that anyone wants to switch their bookmarks
	format frequently, so this is not too high on our TODO list. So
	be sure to tell us if you would like this process to be
	simplified rather sooner than later.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;The Wonders of Tabbed Browsing</h3>

<p>

	In this information age with our stream of consciousness constantly
	being dispersed by links to different resources on the Net, it is a
	challenge to keep track of where you are going. The need for being
	able access several pages in parallel arises. Tabbed browsing gives
	you an easy way to browse multiple sites in parallel.


</p>
<p>

	If you are not already familiar with the concept of tabbed browsing
	you can think of a tab as a separate browsing context with its own
	history and the various other browsing state information, like search
	word and document loading.  Whenever you stumble upon a link to a
	document that you want to follow without leaving the current document,
	you can open it in a new tab. This makes it possible to more easily
	jump between pages on the Net and removes the need for running more
	than one ELinks to do that.


</p>
<p>

	Options related to tabs are located under ``User Interface -> Window
	Tabs'' in the option manager. In the configuration file the naming
	prefix is ``ui.tabs''.


</p>
<p>

	Tabbed browsing has been supported since version 0.9.0 and is fairly
	complete. The documentation on tabs is therefore divided into two
	chapters: a general introduction and an introduction to advanced
	topics.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor22">3.1</a>&nbsp;Introduction to the basic actions involving tabs</h4>

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor23">3.1.1</a>&nbsp;The tab bar and the tab menu</h4>

<p>

	The current state of all opened tabs are displayed in the tab bar. The
	tab bar will by default become visible when more than one tab is open,
	but this is configurable. For each open tab, the document title will
	be shown, possibly truncated. The current tab is highlighted. The tab
	bar will also display a load meter for tabs that are loading
	documents. Finally, any tab that has not been selected since its
	document was loaded will be marked as ``fresh'' by using a different
	coloring scheme.


</p>
<p>

	The tab menu gives access to tab specific actions along with
	some other useful document specific actions. So even if you
	haven't configured keybindings for all actions, chances are you
	will find it in the tab menu. It is by default opened by
	pressing 'e'.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor24">3.1.2</a>&nbsp;Creating new tabs</h4>

<p>

	When creating new tabs, it is possible to specify whether to
	create the tab and make it the current active tab or if the tab
	is to be created ``in the background''--that is, without it
	taking over the focus.


</p>
<p>

	Tabs can be created either with or without specifying a desired
	first document to load. That is, you can open links or submitted
	forms in a new tab or just open a new tab. Depending on your
	configuration, the latter will load the configured homepage in
	the newly created tab or simply leave the tab blank with no
	loaded document.


</p>
<p>

	By default, 't' will open a new tab and 'T' will open the
	current link in a new backgrounded tab. You can configure
	keybindings for opening a new tab in the background and opening
	the current link as the active tab.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor25">3.1.3</a>&nbsp;Switching between tabs</h4>

<p>

	By default, it is possible to switch between tabs by using '&lt;'
	and '&gt;' to select the previous and next tab. When currently
	positioned at the leftmost tab and switching to the previous tab
	the switching between tabs will perform a wrap-around so that
	the rightmost tab will be selected. The wrap-around behaviour is
	configurable.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.3.1.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor26">3.1.4</a>&nbsp;Closing tabs</h4>

<p>

	Tabs can by default be closed by pressing 'c'. It is possible to
	optionally have a confirmation dialog pop up when closing a tab
	to avoid accidental closing. To complement closing of the
	current tab, it is also possible to close all tabs but the
	current one. No key is by default configured for this; the tab
	menu, however, provides this ability.


</p>
<p>

	Note: downloads initiated from a tab are in no way tied to that
	tab, so tabs can be closed while the download will be
	unaffected.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor28">3.2.1</a>&nbsp;Moving tabs</h4>

<p>

	Newly created tabs are always positioned as the rightmost tab,
	but it is possible to move the current tab either to the left or
	the right. The default keybindings have them bound to Alt-< and
	Alt->. Note, however, that there are problems recognizing those

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor29">3.2.2</a>&nbsp;Saving and restoring tabs</h4>

<p>

	Several features use bookmarks to save tabs; they will create a
	folder and bookmark therein the currently displayed document of
	each tab:


</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>

	You can explicitly command all tabs to be bookmarked. This will
	ask you for a folder name in which the tabs will be bookmarked.


</li>
<li>

	At startup and shutdown tabs can automatically be bookmarked in
	order to save and restore the browsing state. Note that when
	restoring, all history information will be gone. It is possible
	to configure both tab saving and restoring via options in ``UI
	-> Sessions''.


</li>
<li>

	As a mean of crash protection, tabs can periodically be saved so
	that it is later possible to reconstruct opened tabs. In case of
	a clean shutdown periodically saved tabs will be removed.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;Marks (the lite edition)</h3>

<p>

	So, were you ever reading this huge 300-pages specification
	heavily cross-referencing itself, jumping around and getting a
	headache when looking for the place where you stopped reading
	the last time?


</p>
<p>

	Were you doing something similar in C code, but praising *vi*
	for document marks?


</p>
<p>

	ELinks can do them, too! For vim non-users:


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor31">4.1</a>&nbsp;What it is?</h4>

<p>

	When you place a "document mark" (just "mark" from now on), you
	place an _invisible_ anchor at the current position in the
	document. You can place several such marks --- each mark is
	identified by a single character (any reasonable character will
	do). Then, you can just happily browse around aimlessly (but see
	below) and when in the same document again, you can return to
	any of the marks in the file again. That will restore your
	position in the file at the time of placing the mark.


</p>
<p>

	You can place a mark by the "m" key followed by the mark
	character. You can go to a mark by the "'" (apostrophe) key
	followed by the mark character. E.g., you can place a mark named
	"a" in the file by pressing "ma", then return to it anytime
	later by typing "'a". You can of course change those shortcuts
	at any time to anything you wish in the keybindings manager.


</p>
<p>

	Short summary: you can place a mark (e.g. 'z') in a document by
	pressing "mz" and then go back to it anytime later by pressing
	"'z".


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor32">4.2</a>&nbsp;Restrictions</h4>

<p>

	To make a good start, one non-restriction comes first. The
	document marks are local to the document. That means you can
	have a mark "x" in one document and another mark "x" in another
	document and ELinks won't mind and it will get it right each
	time.


</p>
<p>

	Now for the restrictions. ALL the document marks are always
	local to the document. I.e. the vim text editor has an extension
	that makes the capital-letter marks to be global to the whole
	program and going to such a mark will make it to open the right
	document. This is not implemented in ELinks _yet_.


</p>
<p>

	Contrary to vim, ELinks doesn't support numbered marks (jumping
	to the last n documents in history) nor the special "'" mark
	(jumping to the last mark). Yet.


</p>
<p>

	There is no way to get a listing of all marks set in a document.
	Yet.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor33">4.3</a>&nbsp;Marks lifespan</h4>

<p>

	I already hinted something about another restriction regarding
	aimless browsing. The lifespan of document marks depends on
	rather ill-defined and (for an average mortal) mostly
	non-deterministic technical conditions.


</p>
<p>

	Generally, marks _always_ survive when not moving away from the
	document or when moving only in the session history (and
	unhistory). That means, if you go back and the "unback" to the
	document, you will find your marks safely in place. If you
	follow a link from the document (or typed an address to the Goto
	URL dialog) and then go back (by pressing the right arrow or
	through the File menu), your marks are safe too. These are in
	fact by far the most common usage cases for the marks, so most
	of the time it will just work as you expect.  That's a good
	news.


</p>
<p>

	The bad news is that in all other cases, nothing is guaranteed.
	It might work if you get back to the document by any other means
	(by following some link or typing its address to the Goto URL
	dialog), or it might not. It might be possible to achieve two
	instances of the document inside a single ELinks, each with its
	own set of marks. However, again, generally it will work as
	expected - this paragraph serves only as a disclaimer in cases
	it doesn't.  Don't rely on it.


</p>
<p>

	Marks never survive over ELinks restarts. If you quit your
	ELinks completely and run it again, the marks you placed will be
	no more. No exceptions. Well. In some cases, it *might* appear
	that they survived, but that just means you did not quit your
	ELinks _completely_ --- if you run multiple ELinks instances
	under a single user on a single system, they "join" together and
	you must quit (or kill) them all to get rid of the damn thing.
	But that's a different story.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;URL Shortcuts in ELinks</h3>

<p>

	One extremely useful and convenient feature on ELinks which is
	presumably not very well known is so-called URL rewriting. If
	you give ELinks a URL (by passing it on the command line,
	through the -remote magic device or most frequently by typing it
	to the Goto URL dialog), it can mangle it in certain ways before
	processing it.  This mangling is called URI rewriting.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor35">5.1</a>&nbsp;What it does</h4>

<p>

	The URI rewriting can expand certain URL shortcuts to complete
	URLs. For example, if you type 'sd' to the Goto URL dialog, it
	will get rewritten to


</p><pre>
		http://www.slashdot.org/
</pre>

<p>

	first, then loaded --- /.'s front page will be displayed.


</p>
<p>

	More so, if you type 'g elinks' to the Goto URL dialog, it will
	be rewritten to


</p><pre>
		http://www.google.com/search?q=elinks&amp;btnG=Google+Search
</pre>

<p>

	and then loaded --- therefore, a Google search for the 'elinks'
	keyword will ensue. Note that you can separate the 'g' by either
	a space or a colon, so 'g:elinks' will do the exact same thing.


</p>
<p>

	A large number of those shortcuts is already predefined. You can
	browse the Protocols :: URI Rewriting :: Dumb/Smart prefixes in
	the Options Manager for complete listing of already defined
	shortcuts (press the [Info] button on a shortcut to see what it
	gets rewritten to). See below for details on how to
	enable/disable this rewriting and how to define own shortcuts.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor36">5.2</a>&nbsp;How it works</h4>

<p>

	All the URI rewriting can be controlled by options in the
	'protocol.rewrite' options tree.


</p>
<p>

	In the 'sd' case, URI rewriting mechanism called 'dumb prefix'
	is used.  If protocol.rewrite.enable-dumb is true, ELinks looks
	at the contents of protocol.rewrite.dumb tree, and if it finds
	option protocol.rewrite.dumb.sd, it will use its value as the
	target URI.


</p>
<p>

	Therefore, in the general way, if ELinks looks at
	protocol.rewrite.dumb.&lt;typed_string&gt; and if it exists, it
	replaces the URI with it. These dumb prefixes can be used as
	kind of alternative bookmarks - if you want to have a fast
	access to a certain site and you don't want to spend lengthy
	seconds navigating in the bookmarks manager, you can just fire
	up the Goto URL dialog, type the shortcut and there you go.


</p>
<p>

	A dumb prefix can contain '%c', which will be replaced by the
	URI of the current document. This is used, for example, in the
	'arc' dumb-prefix, which provides a shortcut to the Wayback
	machine at archive.org.


</p>
<p>

	In the 'g' case, a slightly different URI rewriting mechanism
	called 'smart prefixes' is used. If
	protocol.rewrite.enable-smart is true, ELinks looks at the
	contents of protocol.rewrite.smart tree and if it finds option
	protocol.rewrite.smart.g, it will use its value as the target
	URI.


</p>
<p>

	The difference is that the smart prefixes can take arguments and
	reference them in the target URI. As with dumb prefixes, '%c' in
	the URI means the current address. Additionally, '%s' will be
	substituted by the whole string following the prefix ('elinks'
	in the 'g' example above; '%s' is by far the most frequently
	used expansion), while you can reference individual
	space-separated arguments with the codes '%0' thru '%9'.
	Finally, if you want a plain % to the resulting URI, use '%%'.


</p>
<p>

	Note that the prefix searched in the protocol.rewrite.smart tree
	is everything in the typed address up to the first space or
	colon (so 'bug:123' and 'bug 123' make no difference). These
	prefixes are generally useful for searching anything very fast -
	be it Google ('g:foo', 'gi:foo', 'gr:foo', ...), ELinks Bugzilla
	bugs ('bug:1234'), RFC database ('cr:foo'), or Czech-English
	dictionary ('czen:foo'). But only your imagination is the limit.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor37">5.3</a>&nbsp;Alternative URI rewriting mechanisms</h4>

<p>

	In the past before this was implemented, Lua scripting did the
	job. And you still have complete control over the URI in the
	internal scripting goto-url hook. The advantages are clear - you
	get complete control over the URI and you can do much more
	interesting things with it (e.g., there is some very advanced
	CVSweb and Debian packages database URIs prefixes support in the
	sample Lua hooks file). One disadvantage is clear too - you must
	have Lua scripting enabled in order to make use of this, and
	many users don't have Lua installed.  Another hidden
	disadvantage is that the goto-url hook is not triggered all the
	times when the built-in URI rewriting has its say on the URL.
	Specifically, the goto-url hook isn't triggered when the URL is
	passed on the command line.

<a name="rfc.section.6"></a><h3>6.&nbsp;The Terminal Setup</h3>

<p>

	ELinks uses neither (n)curses nor termcap/terminfo, so unless
	you are using a terminal that is known by ELinks and have a
	built-in configuration (see below for a list), it might be
	required that you do a little configuring of how your terminal
	should be handled. The easiest way to do this is using the
	Terminal Options dialog located in the Setup submenu of the Main
	menu.


</p>
<p>

	It is possible to have configurations for multiple terminals as
	long as the TERM environment variable -- used to distinguish
	terminals from one another -- is set to something different for
	each terminal. So be sure to set TERM to different values for
	two terminals that cannot share the same configuration.  For
	example, always setting TERM to xterm-color can lead to problems
	if you run ELinks under the Linux console. This is because the
	Linux console does not support underlining and ELinks will not
	know that underlined characters will have to be color
	highlighted so they stand out.


</p>
<p>

	In short, ELinks does not use termcap or terminfo. ELinks uses
	$TERM, but only to distinguish between terminals in its own
	configuration. That is, you need only configure your terminal
	within ELinks: Go to the Setup menu and select Terminal Options.
	If $TERM is set to 'screen' when you configure ELinks' terminal
	settings, ELinks will remember to use those settings when $TERM
	is 'screen'.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor39">6.1</a>&nbsp;Options</h4>

<p>

	Apart from the last charset option configurable through the
	Setup -> Character Set submenu in the Main menu, the rest can be
	configured using the Terminal Options dialog.

	It maps roughly to the terminal type, such as Linux console,
	XTerm, VT100 etc. It matters mostly when drawing frames and
	borders around dialog windows. As already mentioned, it also
	turns on certain features which try to compensate for
	``missing'' terminal capabilities when drawing. Special
	highlighting of underlined text if underlining is not supported
	is one such thing.

<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;Introduction to MIME handling</h3>

<p>

	At some time along the 0.4 prereleases, ELinks replaced the old
	Links file configuration system with its own one. Now, the
	configuration is stored in elinks.conf, much more complete and
	featuring a new syntax. You can set most options from the UI (so
	usually there is no need to deal with elinks.conf), and that
	used to be true for setting MIME handlers and extensions as
	well; but now the associations menu is gone temporarily, forcing
	you to set the handlers from the configuration file.


</p>
<p>

	The comments provided within elinks.conf for the MIME options
	are not much helpful, and those options may seem a bit obscure
	or confusing at first.  This document is a basic introduction to
	setting of MIME associations for ELinks. If you want to know how
	to automatically launch a program to view some kind of file
	(like images), then read on. Some basic knowledge of MIME is
	recommended.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor51">7.1</a>&nbsp;Handling MIME types, the ELinks way</h4>

<a name="rfc.section.7.1.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor52">7.1.1</a>&nbsp;What are MIME types and why may you want to use them?</h4>

<p>

	If, while browsing with ELinks, you need to display files that
	it can't show (like images or PDF documents), then you will
	likely want to pass them to other programs that are suitable for
	this task. While you may do it manually (saving the file to
	disk, running the auxiliar program to show it and then removing
	the file when finished), ELinks provides a method to do this
	automatically using MIME types.


</p>
<p>

	ELinks usually knows what the MIME type is for any file (which
	is a kind of description of its format), thus you only need to
	specify how to manage the MIME types for the files you want to
	open. If you don't tell ELinks how to manage a given MIME type
	then it will show you on screen the contents of the file (as if
	it was ASCII text) instead of calling an external program to
	show them.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor53">7.1.2</a>&nbsp;Associating files to MIME types</h4>

<p>

	If the file is fetched from a web server then this web server
	should tell ELinks what its MIME type is, so you should have
	generally no need to care about it. However, the web server
	might send an incorrect type, or you may be retrieving it by FTP
	or from your local filesystem, so sometimes ELinks needs to
	guess it.


</p>
<p>

	The easiest method to guess a MIME type for a file is to just
	look at its name trusting it was given the right extension.
	ELinks supports this, letting you to specify a type for any
	given extension.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor54">7.1.3</a>&nbsp;Managing a given MIME type</h4>

<p>

	This usually means specifying programs to open files of this
	type and the conditions in which those programs may be used. For
	instance, you may want to use zgv (a popular svgalib image
	viewer) when you are using the text console, but xli (a image
	viewer for X) when running the X window system.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1.3.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor55">7.1.3.1</a>&nbsp;Binding it to a handler</h4>

<p>

	Instead of directly attaching a program to a MIME type, ELinks
	lets you associate an abstract handler to each type. Then you
	can specify which programs implement the handler and how are
	they used.


</p>
<p>

	For instance, you may create an image_viewer handler and assign
	it to MIME types image/jpeg, image/png and image/gif. Then you
	would associate to image_viewer the programs you would like to
	use for viewing images and the details on how to use them. This
	is less cumbersome than repeating all these details for each
	MIME type.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor56">7.1.4</a>&nbsp;Specifying the details for a handler</h4>

<p>

	There are three issues to specify for a handler: the program
	associated to it, whether you want confirmation before using it
	and whether you want the terminal to be blocked while it is
	being used.


</p>
<p>

	When specifying any of these issues, you must tell ELinks the
	situation in which it gets applied, which is typically either
	the text console or the X window sytem. So you can specify that
	you don't want confirmation before running the program when
	running X, and that you want it otherwise.  Similarly, when you
	are attaching a program (name it foo) to this handler you must
	tell if it's for X or not (you can attach a second program for
	the other choice if you want).


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1.4.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor57">7.1.4.1</a>&nbsp;Attaching a program to it</h4>

<p>

	You must tell ELinks the exact command for running it (with any
	options you wish). In place of the filename you must enter %.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1.4.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor58">7.1.4.2</a>&nbsp;Choosing whether you want confirmation before applying it</h4>

<p>

	This is rather simple. If you choose not to do so, then the
	handler will be automatically called upon when you demand ELinks
	to show something attached to this handler. Otherwise, if you
	ask for confirmation, you will be prompted to open it with a
	external program, with additional choices that include
	cancelling the operation and viewing it with ELinks. E.g: you
	may use this option for programs written in C so that you may
	always choose if you want to read the source with ELinks, or if
	you want to save it, or if you want to use indent to display it
	with less.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.1.4.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor59">7.1.4.3</a>&nbsp;Choosing whether to block the terminal</h4>

<p>

	If you don't want to allow going back to ELinks (or any other
	program from the same terminal) before the external program
	ends, then you should ask to block the terminal.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor60">7.2</a>&nbsp;Setting up elinks.conf</h4>

<p>

	If you have old configuration files from old ELinks versions or
	from Links, then you may use the conf-links2elinks.pl script
	(which is placed at contrib/conv/ on the source distribution) to
	convert them to the new format. If you don't use it you will
	need to edit the configuration file, and here you will find how.

<a name="rfc.section.7.2.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor61">7.2.1</a>&nbsp;Associating a file extension to a MIME type</h4>

<p>

	You can still do this with the UI, from the the Setup-&gt;File
	Extensions submenu.


</p>
<p>

	If you want to do so from the configuration file, enter set
	mime.extension.ext = "type", replacing ext with the appropiate
	file extension, and type with its MIME type. E.g. you may want
	to have set mime.extension.jpg = "image/jpeg".


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.2.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor62">7.2.2</a>&nbsp;Defining a handler</h4>

<p>

	For each handler you must define three items, specifying in what
	context the value of the item should be applied. You must enter
	set mime.handler.handler-name.item.context = value, replacing
	handler-name with the name for the handler you are defining,
	item with the item you are defining for this handler, context
	with the context this item value is to be applied, and value
	with the value you want to assign to the item. You must do so
	for each of the available items: program, ask and block.


</p>
<p>

	The value for program is a string with the exact command you
	want to be issued to view the file, placing % were you would put
	the file name. The values for ask and block are either 0 (no) or
	1 (yes). Available contexts include unix and unix-xwin, which
	mean UNIX text terminal and X respectively (others can be os2,
	win32, beos, riscos, ...). The latter does not mean you are
	running ELinks from X, just that the DISPLAY variable is set so
	that ELinks may run an X program.


</p>
<p>

	To illustrate it, here is an example. Suppose you want to define
	the image_viewer handler which should be used to view images.
	The configuration file may look like this:


</p><pre>
	set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix.ask = 1
	set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix-xwin.ask = 0

	set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix.block = 1
	set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix-xwin.block = 0

	set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix.program = "zgv %"
	set mime.handler.image_viewer.unix-xwin.program = "xli %"
</pre>

<p>

	In this example the image_viewer handler uses the svgalib image
	viewer zgv when X is not available, and the X image viewer xli
	when it is. The terminal would be blocked when X is not
	available and it would not be when it's available. Finally,
	ELinks would ask for confirmation before using the handler only
	with X not available.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.7.2.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor63">7.2.3</a>&nbsp;Associating a MIME type to a handler</h4>

<p>

	Just enter set mime.type.class.name = "handler", replacing class
	with the class for the mime type, name with the specific name
	within that class, and handler with the name for the handler you
	want to assign to the MIME type. E.g. you may want to have set
	mime.type.image.jpeg = "image_viewer".

<a name="rfc.section.8"></a><h3>8.&nbsp;Managing External Viewers with Mailcap</h3>

<p>

	This document describes the support for Mailcap (RFC 1524) in
	ELinks. It does not describe the mailcap format. There are
	plenty of documents on the Web that does this. Google and thou
	wilt find. ;)


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.8.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor65">8.1</a>&nbsp;A Short Intro to Mailcap</h4>

<p>

	Mailcap is a file format defined in RFC 1524. Its purpose is to
	inform multiple mail reading user agent (MUA) programs about the
	locally-installed facilities for handling mail in various
	formats. It is designed to work with the Multipurpose Internet
	Mail Extensions, known as MIME.


</p>
<p>

	ELinks allows MIME handlers to be defined using its own
	configuration system, so why support mailcap? It can be seen as
	an alternative or simply as a supplement for setting up MIME
	handlers in ELinks.  Mailcap files are present on most UNIX
	systems--usually in /etc/mailcap--so this makes it possible for
	ELinks to know how to handle a great variety of file formats
	with little configuration. To be able to use mailcap, it has to
	be compiled into ELinks.  This is the default. If you don't need
	mailcap support, just configure ELinks with the flag:
	--disable-mailcap.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.8.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor66">8.2</a>&nbsp;Parameters to Mailcap Entries</h4>

<p>

	The code has been ported from Mutt and thereby inherits some of
	its various features and limitation.


</p>
<p>

	The following parameters are supported:


</p><table class="data" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="20%">Parameter</th>
<th align="left" width="80%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">%s	</td>
<td align="left">The filename that contains the data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">%f	</td>
<td align="left">The content type, like 'text/plain'.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
</p>
<p>

	The following parameters are not supported, since they do not
	really make much sense for a non-MUA program:


</p><table class="data" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<th align="left" width="20%">Parameter</th>
<th align="left" width="80%">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">%n		</td>
<td align="left">The integer number of sub-parts in the multipart</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">%F		</td>
<td align="left">The "content-type filename" repeated for each sub-part</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">%{parameter}	</td>
<td align="left">The "parameter" value from the content-type field</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
</p>
<a name="rfc.section.8.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor67">8.3</a>&nbsp;Reading of Mailcap Files</h4>

<p>

	Mailcap files will be read when starting ELinks. The mailcap
	files to use will be found from the mailcap path, a colon
	separated list of files similar to the $PATH environment
	variable. The mailcap path will be determined in the following
	way:


</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>

	From the value of the mime.mailcap.path option in
	elinks.conf; for example:

<pre>
	set mime.mailcap.path = "~/.mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap"
</pre>

</li>
<li>

	From MAILCAP environment variable.


</li>
<li>

	If non of the above is defined, the mailcap path defaults to
	"~/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap".


</li>
</ol>
<a name="rfc.section.8.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor68">8.4</a>&nbsp;Fields</h4>

<p>

	Since mailcap handling is primarily for displaying of resources,
	all fields like edit, print, compose etc. are ignored.


</p>
<p>

	Note: Test commands are supported, but unfortunately, it's not
	possible to provide the file when running the test. So any test
	that requires a file will be considered failed and the handler
	will not be used.


</p>
<p>

	Unfortunately, there are no 'native' support for the
	copiousoutput field.  The field basicly mean 'needs pager'. So
	it is handled by appending a pipe and a pager program to the
	command. The pager program will be read from the PAGER
	environment variable. If this fails, test are made for common
	pager programs (/usr/bin/pager, /usr/bin/less and /usr/bin/more
	in that order). So if you define png2ascii as your handler for
	image/png and specify copiousoutput then the executed command
	will be "png2ascii |/usr/bin/less" if less is your pager or
	present on your system.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.8.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor69">8.5</a>&nbsp;Mailcap Configuration</h4>

<p>

	Apart from the mime.mailcap.path option, you can configure if
	mailca support should be disabled. The default being that it is
	enabled. To disable it just put:


</p><pre>
	set mime.mailcap.enable = 0
</pre>

<p>

	in elinks.conf.


</p>
<p>

	It is also possible to control wether ELinks should ask you
	before opening a file. The option is a boolian and can be set
	like this:


</p><pre>
	set mime.mailcap.ask = 1
</pre>

<p>

	if you would like to be asked before opening a file.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.8.6"></a><h4><a name="anchor70">8.6</a>&nbsp;Some Sample Mailcap Entries</h4>

<a name="rfc.section.9"></a><h3>9.&nbsp;The tale of ex-mode</h3>

<p>

	Are you a vim-controls nerd who wants to see them everywhere?
	Welcome.


</p>
<p>

	Actually ELinks doesn't shine in this area yet very much. Heck,
	the famous hjkl foursome is still occupied by some feeble
	managers in the default keymap (we have that in our monumental
	TODO lists). Still, if you know what to touch during the
	compilation (--enable-exmode), you can get at least some
	familiar reply to the mighty ':' (colon) grip.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.9.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor72">9.1</a>&nbsp;What it is</h4>

<p>

	Ex-mode gives you some (still very rough and only marginally
	complete) access to advanced ELinks commands, to be invoked
	anywhere anytime, straight and fast.


</p>
<p>

	When you activate the ex-mode (named after the equivalent gadget
	in the vi text editor flavours), a command line appears at the
	bottom of the screen for you to type the commands.


</p>
<p>

	Only two kinds of commands are supported so far. First,
	(almost?) anything that can appear in the configuration file can
	be used in ex-mode. Second, you can invoke (almost) any action
	from the ex-mode.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.9.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor73">9.2</a>&nbsp;Configuration directives in exmode</h4>

<p>

	There aren't many of these, so we can skim through them fast.


</p>
<p>

	If you want to flip an option you know by name and refuse to
	engage with the option manager visuals, you can just drop in to
	the ex-mode and type 'set the.option = 1234'. See man
	elinks.conf (5) or the options manager for the list of options;
	you can also get a complete options tree saved to elinks.conf if
	you set config.saving_style = 2 (but do NOT keep that setting
	unless you know what are you doing; if we change a default value
	of some option in future releases, we (generally) know what are
	we doing - this change won't propagate to you during an upgrade
	if you already have the original default value saved in your
	configuration file, though).


</p>
<p>

	It's the same story with keybindings. You can use 'bind "main"
	"h" = "move-cursor-left"'. It's not the same story with
	keybindings documentation.  There is the elinkskeys (5) manual
	page but it's horribly obsolete, so don't rely on it. You can
	refer to the keybindings manager for names of actions and even
	their short descriptions. Also, all the 'bind' commands are
	saved to the configuration file if you set config.saving_style =
	2 (but see above).


</p>
<p>

	You can also use 'include my.conf', which will read my.conf as
	an ELinks configuration file.


</p>
<p>

	Actually, ELinks would eat '#blahblah blah' too, if you see a
	point in feeding it that kind of stuff.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.9.3"></a><h4><a name="anchor74">9.3</a>&nbsp;Actions in exmode - or exmode in action?</h4>

<p>

	There is too many of these, so we should better skim through
	them fast.


</p>
<p>

	Actually, we already talked about them. It's the last argument
	to the 'bind' command. So, they are those listed in the
	keybinding manager. So if you enter 'move-cursor-left' command,
	it will move your cursor left - by a single character, making
	this a little awkward, but it's useful if you sometimes want to
	easily invoke an action and you don't want to waste a key for
	it.


</p>
<p>

	Actually, actions could theoretically take arguments too. This
	is currently implemented only for the 'goto-url' action, which
	can take the location it should go at as a parameter (otherwise
	it opens the standard well-known dialog as if you pressed 'g' in
	the default keymap).


</p>
<p>

	Regarding the mysterious "(almost)" hinted above, you can never
	invoke the "quit" action from the exmode - if you type it there,
	"really-quit" is invoked instead.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.9.4"></a><h4><a name="anchor75">9.4</a>&nbsp;How to use it</h4>

<p>

	It's simple. You press ':' (without the apostrophes, of course)
	and type in the command, then you press enter.  E.g., ':set
	config.saving_style = 3' (this is a good thing), ':quit' (and
	the game is over). The standard line-editing facility is present
	(cursor keys and so), and the ex-mode input line has own
	history.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.9.5"></a><h4><a name="anchor76">9.5</a>&nbsp;The "but"s</h4>

<p>

	The biggest usability hurdle so far is that there is no
	tab-completion. This is why the ex-mode support is not enabled
	by default and part of the reason why its practical usage is
	somewhat limited yet - if you don't remember exactly what do you
	want to invoke, tough beans. Someone shall address this issue in
	the future.


</p>
<p>

	Also, perhaps wider scale of commands should be implemented in
	ex-mode. The code is extremely flexible and it is very trivial
	to make another ex-mode command handler, it's just that no one
	has done it yet ;-). Also, more actions should be able to take
	arguments.

<a name="rfc.section.10"></a><h3>10.&nbsp;Managing remote ELinks instances with -remote</h3>

<p>

	Some programs provide the ability to pass URIs to external
	programs.  When stumbling upon a reference to a page you want to
	see, it is sometimes a kludge to copy and paste it into ELinks.
	This is where -remote can be a nifty solution.


</p>
<p>

	When invoking ELinks with the -remote argument, it does not
	start a new instance, but instead connects to an already running
	ELinks, making it possible to control that ELinks instance. The
	-remote command line switch takes a command consisting of the
	action to invoke and any parameters to the action.  Here is an
	example for opening freshmeat.net in a new tab:


</p><pre>
	$ elinks -remote "openURL(http://freshmeat.net/, new-tab)"
</pre>

<p>

	When running this command in a terminal, you will see a small
	delay before ELinks returns. If no running instance was found,
	it will return with the error message:


</p><pre>
	ELinks: No remote session to connect to.
</pre>

<p>

	All URLs passed to the openURL() commands can be URL prefixes,
	so the command above could have simply used ``openURL(fm,
	new-tab)''.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.10.1"></a><h4><a name="anchor78">10.1</a>&nbsp;Limitations and outstanding issues</h4>

<p>

	Remote control is implemented using the intercommunication
	socket created in ~/.elinks/, so the command has to be run on
	the same machine as the instance you want to control; or put
	differently: the two ELinkses need to share a file system that
	supports socket files, which rules out usage of -remote over
	NFS.  This also implies that the ELinks instance you want to
	control should be started without passing -no-home nor
	-no-connect.


</p>
<p>

	The built-in -remote support is to some degree compatible with
	the one Mozilla provides
	(http://www.mozilla.org/unix/remote.html), but with some
	homebrew extensions added and few unsupported features. All the
	supported actions are documented below.


</p>
<p>

	Under some circumstances, use of the -remote control can cause
	ELinks to become unresponsive. This is cause by the current key
	press and mouse focus being redirected to new tabs or dialogs
	opened by the -remote action.


</p>
<a name="rfc.section.10.2"></a><h4><a name="anchor79">10.2</a>&nbsp;Remote Actions</h4>

<p>

	The command syntax is case-insensitive. For readability, we use
	the casing in the listing of supported commands.


</p>
<p>

	Mozilla -remote compatible commands:


</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>ping():</dt>
<dd>

	Checks for existence of a remote instance. Makes it possible for
	scripts to query if remote controlling is possible.


</dd>
<dt>openURL():</dt>
<dd>

	Prompts for a URL in current tab by opening the Goto dialog.


</dd>
<dt>openURL(URL):</dt>
<dd>

	Open the passed URL in current tab.


</dd>
<dt>openURL(URL, new-tab):</dt>
<dd>

	Opens the passed URL in new tab.


</dd>
<dt>openURL(URL, new-window):</dt>
<dd>

	Opens the passed URL in new window.


</dd>
<dt>xfeDoCommand(openBrowser):</dt>
<dd>

	Opens an ELinks instance in a new window. This ELinks instance
	will connect to the already running one.


</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>

	ELinks extensions:


</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>addBookmark(URL):</dt>
<dd>

	Bookmarks the passed URL.


</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>

	-remote can also take a list of URLs without an explicit action,
	in which case the URL arguments will be opened in new tabs in
	the remote instance. For example, by running:


</p>
<p>

	$ elinks -remote slashdot.org fm g:elinks


</p>
<p>

	new tabs containing slashdot.org, freshmeat.net and a Google
	search of elinks will be opened.
