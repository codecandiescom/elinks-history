This is a super-simplistic CSS micro-engine.

				    Phases

The CSS handling is divided into:

* The scanner

It takes care of composing tokens from a string containing CSS source. It
also takes care of eliminating either garbage code that was not recognized
or things like whitespace and comments. The scanner will not attempt to
recover from this garbage code but merely signal them to the upper layers.

The scanner only works with strings but is a bit more high level than
scanners in the sense of flex. The string "10em" will not just generate the
two tokens <number>, <identifier> but rather combine them into one token.
This only leads to problems with tokens of the sort #<identifier> that can
be both a hex color or hash so should not be a problem but rather mean that
we will do less scanner calls.

The scanner lives in scanner.*

* The parser

It takes a string with CSS code, composes tokens (from the scanner) into
some meaningful syntax and transforms it to an internal set of structures
describing the data (let's call it a "rawer"). It currently does no recovery
when something unexpected shows up but skips to next special control char.

The parser lives in parser.* and value.*

* The applier

It applies style info from a syntax tree (parsed ELinks or document
stylesheet) or fragment of one (in the case of style="" attributes) to the
current element.

The applier lives in apply.*


			      The current state

Currently we both check the element's 'style' attribute, content of <style>
tags and imports from either <link> tags in the HTML header or @imports from
the CSS code. But we lack a proper way to handle the cascading. Now it will
automatically scan the current element, and if a 'style' attribute is found,
it is parsed and applied to the current element.  If there is no 'style'
attribute it will look up any styles retrieved from the document stylesheet
and last try styles from the default user controlled stylesheet. TODO: We
should always look up <style> tags and only apply those not found in any
'style' attribute.

One big problem with the current way of doing things is inheritance, there
is no way we are telling the HTML engine what is going to be inherited and
what is not. The other problem is precedence, currently even global
stylesheet takes precedence over local classic-formatting attributes (we
just css_apply() like mad on various places to make sure the CSS attributes
are stuffed through HTML engine's throat). These two problems will be solved
when the HTML engine is converted to work with stylesheets natively (instead
of format + par_format).
