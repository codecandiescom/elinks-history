When you add or delete any text, add or delete it in english.lng and run script
./synclang. It adds NULL entries to other languages, then it runs ./gen-intl.

When you change any text, run ./get-intl. It will generate big header file from
the language files and place it inside src/intl/.

Menu hotkeys are also translated via this interface. You can specify more
hotkeys. When using normal letters as hotkeys, always use upper case. When using
some characters above 128, specify both upper and lower letters.

There's a nice guide written by Petr Kulhavy <brain@artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>:

Instructions how to add a new language to links:

 1) cd intl
 2) cp english.lng your_language.lng
 3) vi your language.lng
 4) change the string in quotes on the line T__CHAR_SET (first line of
    the file) to the charset of your translation
 5) change the string in quotes on the line T__LANGUAGE (second line) to
    name of your language
 6) translate all the texts (T_<something>) to your language, don't mangle
    small and capital letters
 7) change the hotkeys (T_HK_<something>) to hotkey you want
 8) vi index.txt
 9) add your language (only the name without the .lng suffix) to
    index.txt on single line
10) ./synclang
11) cd ..
12) make
13) check if the translation is correct
14) send it to links-discuss
