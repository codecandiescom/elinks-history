Known bugs:


	Can't connect to some FTP servers (Novell, NT). Connection stays in
"Request sent" state.

	Frames don't work if there's more frames with same name. Turn them off
in such case.

	You can't upload large files; it takes _lots_ of memory.

	You shouldn't press '^Z' when you are in a viewer

	Handling of &#13; is not lynx-compatible in <pre> tag (should be
newline).

	Tags inside <XMP> are still interpreted.

	When we're running DNS lookup in background and Terminate all
connections on background, we're in big trouble.

	links '...?q=foo+bar' when launching new instance in xterm leads to
incorrectly decoding +ba to 0xba.

	When switching between source view and rendered view, the position of
the view is based on the page number of the previous view, not on the content of
the previous view.

	Calling cfmakeraw() in kbd.c:setraw() breaks some exotic terminal
combinations.

	When title/status bar is turned off, there's still a blank line on
top/bottom of screen.

	About dialog is containing garbage content during a transfer.

	Empty menu will cause ignoring of everything except ^C when you'll
close it.
