Elinks installation guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

##########
  In order to check out the latest tree from CVS:

$ export CVSROOT=check_file_SITES_for_value_of_this
$ cvs login
(empty password)
$ cvs -z3 co elinks
$ cd elinks
...

  To update your checkouted tree to latest version in CVS, do:

$ cvs -z3 update -dP

  If you downloaded nightly snapshot, it already contains CVS/ directories etc.
Thus you should be able to update your tree like if you would checkout the
latest tree from CVS.


##########
  If you'll want to compile elinks, first check directory contrib/, if it
doesn't contain some patches which would be interesting for you. If you're
excited by one, try to apply it by doing

$ patch -p0 <contrib/that-pach

  It may not apply - I don't update patches in contrib/ regularily - if you
want, feel free to go and update the patch for current tree and send me the new
version. Then,

  Unix - just doing:

         $ ./configure
         $ make
         # make install

	 should be enough. However, in some FreeBSD 3 distributions you have to
	 set CFLAGS=-aout before running ./configure.
	
	 If configure fails, you can try generic makefile: make -f Makefile.gen
	 (it won't probably work, though, as it's not maintained anymore).

  OS/2 - you can use ./configure. If it fails or if you don't have bash, use
	 make -f Makefile.gen

	 The only supported compiler is EMX, you probably won't be able to
	 compile it with anything else.

	 configure under OS/2 needs to know paths to gcc, make anb bash. Set
	 (for example):

	 SET HOSTTYPE=i586
	 SET MACHTYPE=i586-pc-os2
	 SET CONFIG_SHELL=d:/prg/gnu/bin/bash.exe
	 SET CC=d:/prg/emx/bin/gcc.exe
	 SET MAKE=d:/prg/emx/bin/make.exe
	 SET EMXOPT=-h100

  Dos, Windows - port it by yourself


##########
  Ok, now let's install it:

  Unix - # make install

  OS/2 - Copy file links.exe somewhere to your path or create CMD file that runs
	 links.

	 WARNING: EMX has nasty limit of open files. Links will work badly or
	 won't work with default settings. Set variable EMXOPT=-h100 before you
	 run links.

  Now, check the contrib/ directory again. There may be some useful configfile
examples there, along with few support tools and some Lua scripts - you probably
want them ;) so just copy the hooks.lua to ~/.links, and edit the configuration
part - it adds various nice functionality to elinks, like decompression of
gzipped files or user-defined protocols.
