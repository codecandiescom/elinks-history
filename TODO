TODO list for links (sorted approximatelly by priority):


	Resuming of downloads (URGENT)

	Passive FTP mode support (needed since client-side firewalls may
block FTP data connections from servers in active mode) 

	Strip spaces from the end of the URL

	Each header file should include full path in anti-reinclude #define

	Support for <xmp>

	Better support for vlink - we have to update already rendered document

	When no WWW_HOME is set, optionally pop up goto dialog upon startup

	Use terminfo instead of hardwired ANSI control sequences

	Improve keybinding so that it works more universally

	Mouse buttonbinding ;)

	User interface for keys rebinding

	User interface for options changing

	Reorganization of user interface

	When calling external viewer on files, assign temporary files the
suffix appropriate to the file type.

	Cookies manager

	HTTPS proxy support

	HTTP-proxy-auth support

	Take info about proxies from env variables (?)

	Possibility to read HTML source from stdin

	Passing url to external command (possibly make alt+[0-9] to pass
current link to external command).

	Terminal-specific MIME associations.

	Something like indicator-bar, simple letter-flags indicating current
state of browser, or changeable thru Lua.

	Possibility to use commandline-driven interface instead of BFU
optionally.

	A mechanism that does not overwrite filenames: If two files are to be
saved in the same dir with the same name links should do someting like wget,
which adds .1, .2 ... on the filename and does not overwrite the file that
existed first.

	Insert should toggle insert/overwrite mode.



	Multiple windows in one console

	Generic code cleanup

	Write some more documentation

	Disk cache (?)

	Rewrite html parser (?)

	EcmaScript (?) (http://home.worldcom.ch/~jmlugrin/fesi/)

	Then, support for proxy autoconfiguration
(http://www.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html).

	CSS (?)
