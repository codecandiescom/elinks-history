Welcome, mere mortal, to realm of evil unindented code, heaps of
one^Wtwo-letter variables, seas of gotos accompanied with 30-letters labels in
czech language with absoltely no mean, welcome to the realm of elinks code!

[I'm going to extend this file slowly, basing on daily practice ;]

Don't take this file as a law. I may or may not be right in these issues.


1, Language files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each UI output should use language files in order to be able to translate the
messages to desired language. Those language files reside in intl/ subdir, and
each time when you add/remove something from there, thou shall call ./synclang
script, so that the change will propagate from english.lng to all other
language files and language.h && language.inc files will be generated
automagically. Thou shall NEVER modify those two files manually, or thou wilt
be cursed for the rest of your life and all patches of thee will be trampled
in.


2, Links philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Links is based on the philosophy of asynchronity. That means, you pass callback
to each function, and when the requested task will be finished sometime in the
unclear future, the callback will be called in order to notify you that you can
go on.

When you use multiple links instances at once, normally only one of them is a
'master', and the rest of them are just kinda dumb terminals. So if you want to
test some new feature, you have to start links with '-no-connect' parameter,
otherwise it will just connect to actually running links and you won't see your
new great feature you just added in such a big pain.

There are two basic structures in links. Connection and session - their names
should be self-descriptive. Only note that connection may or may not have
session attached. I.e. if you will type some URL, start loading it and then
press ACT_BACK (KEY_LEFT), connection will lose its session. So you should
never prepend that it has one.

UI just plainly needs rewrite as it's extremely ugly ;-). Cut'n'paste from some
existing code and modify appropriately, if you want one :).

Some common used functions (i.e. malloc() or free()) have their own clones
inside links and you should use them (i.e. mem_alloc() or mem_free()) instead.
See links.h for list of them ;-).

If you want to have anything else documented here, write description and send
me a patch.


3, Coding style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mikulas once told that 'it was hard to code, so it should be hard to read' -
and he drove by this when he has been writing links. However, we do NOT drive
by this rule anymore ;-). I strongly welcome cleanup patches and you have 99%
proximity they will be applied, if they will be correct.

Variable names should be descriptive. Well, in worst case I will accept 'i' for
index, but if possible don't do even this :). You should try to declare them on
the lowest level possible, so their declaration and initialization will be near
their usage and you will also prevent reuse of one variable for two completely
diferent things. Yes, that's another thing you shouldn't do. If reasonable,
initialize variables during their declaration and don't group too much
variables in one line. ALWAYS make blank line after declaration part.

Indent shift width is 8, that means one tab. I'm using to prefer 2, but links
is actually written using 8, and it doesn't appear to be wise to change this.
{ should be in same line as condition near for, if, while, switch etc, but on
separate line near function header in function definition.

Always make spaces around '=', after ',', and - if reasonable - around other
operators as well. You shouldn't make assigments in conditionals, so do:

foo = mem_alloc(1234);
if (!foo) panic("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa");

instead of

if (!(foo = mem_alloc(1234))) panic(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa");

Use blank lines frequently to separate chunks of code. And use magic "/*" and
"*/" to give others an idea about what it does and about possible pitfalls.

Keep in mind that if there's an object and verb in the comment (and it is, in
most cases), it is a sentence, so it has to start with capital letter and end
with a fullstop ;-). If you want to share your opinion or investigations, you
should sign yourself, i.e. /* TODO: Move this far away! --pasky */

All three following styles of comments are acceptable:

/*
 * Bla bla bla.
 * blabla?
 */

/* Bla bla bla.
 * blabla?
 */

/* Bla bla bla.
 * blabla? */

The best one usually depends on the actual context.

If you describe a structure, make either:

        char *name; /* name of the tag */
        void (*func)(unsigned char *); /* function hopefully handling the
                                        * content of the tag */
        int linebreak; /* need for break of a line? */

or

        /* Name of the tag */
        char *name;
        /* Function hopefully handling the content of the tag */
        void (*func)(unsigned char *);
        /* Do we need to break a line? */
        int linebreak;

Same if you comment the code. If the comment is /* then do it now! */, place it
on the same line as the command, if it's
/* We have to parse this crap now, as it is going to be freed in free_crap() */
place it on the preceding line.


4, Patches
~~~~~~~~~~

Please sent unified patches only. Recommended way is:

cp -a elinks/ elinks+mysuperfeature/
cd elinks+mysuperfeature/
*clap clap* *clickety clickey* *make* *./links -no-connect* *goto clap*
cd ..
diff -ru elinks/ elinks+mysuperfeature/ >elinks-mysuperfeature.patch

please manually remove any bloat like changes in ./configure, whistespace
changes etc ;-).

I accept also output from "cvs diff -u" :). Statement about bloat removing
applies.


Happy hacking!
