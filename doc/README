		A few words about documentation for ELinks

There is only limited documentation available for ELinks. Sorry. It basicly
amounts to the documents in this directory and the manpages + README/INSTALL
files in the root.

Other things you will find in this directory are:

	book/ -	Where development on moving existing documentation to docbook
		format does on.

	man/  -	The place where manpages will be moved once they are integrated
		from doc/book/manpages.

	html/ - Will contain (in the future) processed docbook documents.
		Manual pages and man pages should be already processed.

If you'd like to contribute please read book/README.
