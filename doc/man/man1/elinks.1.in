.SH NAME
elinks \- lynx-like alternative character mode WWW browser
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBelinks\fR [ \fBoptions\fR ] \fBurl\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ELinks is a text mode WWW browser, supporting colors,
table rendering, background downloading, menu driven
configuration interface, tabbed browsing and slim code. 
.PP
Frames are supported. You can have different file formats associated
with external viewers. mailto: and telnet: are supported via external
clients. 
.PP
ELinks can handle local (file://) or remote
(http://, ftp:// or
https:// if there's compiled-in SSL support) URLs.
It has also basic support for finger:. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
Most options can be set in the user interface or config file, so
usually you do not need to care about them. Note that this list is by
no means complete and it is not kept up-to-date. To get complete list
of commandline options, start ELinks with parameter
\fI--help\fR.
.TP
\fB-anonymous [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Restrict ELinks so that it can run on an anonymous account.
No local file browsing, no downloads. Execution of viewers
is allowed, but user can't add or modify entries in
association table.
.TP
\fB-auto-submit [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Go and submit the first form you'll stumble upon.
.TP
\fB-base-session <num> (default: 0) \fR
ID of session (ELinks instance) which we want to clone.
This is internal ELinks option, you don't want to use it.
.TP
\fB-default-mime-type (alias for mime.default_type) \fR
Default MIME type to assume for documents of unknown type.
.TP
\fB-dump [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Write a plain-text version of the given HTML document to
stdout.
.TP
\fB-dump-charset (alias for document.dump.codepage) \fR
Codepage used in dump output.
.TP
\fB-dump-width (alias for document.dump.width) \fR
Width of the dump output.
.TP
\fB-eval \fR
Specify elinks.conf config options on the command-line:
-eval 'set protocol.file.allow_special_files = 1'
.TP
\fB-force-html \fR
This makes ELinks assume that the files it sees are HTML. This is
equivalent to -default-mime-type text/html.
.TP
\fB-?, -h, -help \fR
Print usage help and exit.
.TP
\fB-long-help \fR
Print detailed usage help and exit.
.TP
\fB-config-help \fR
Print help on configuration options and exit.
.TP
\fB-lookup \fR
Look up specified host.
.TP
\fB-no-connect [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Run ELinks as a separate instance instead of connecting to an
existing instance. Note that normally no runtime state files
(bookmarks, history and so on) are written to the disk when
this option is used. See also -touch-files.
.TP
\fB-no-home [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Don't attempt to create and/or use home rc directory (~/.elinks).
.TP
\fB-session-ring <num> (default: 0) \fR
ID of session ring this ELinks session should connect to. ELinks
works in so-called session rings, whereby all instances of ELinks
are interconnected and share state (cache, bookmarks, cookies,
and so on). By default, all ELinks instances connect to session
ring 0. You can change that behaviour with this switch and form as
many session rings as you want. Obviously, if the session-ring with
this number doesn't exist yet, it's created and this ELinks instance
will become the master instance (that usually doesn't matter for you
as a user much). Note that you usually don't want to use this unless
you're a developer and you want to do some testing - if you want the
ELinks instances each running standalone, rather use the -no-connect
command-line option. Also note that normally no runtime state files
are written to the disk when this option is used. See also
-touch-files.
.TP
\fB-source [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Write the given HTML document in source form to stdout.
.TP
\fB-stdin [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Open stdin as an HTML document - this is fully equivalent to:
-eval 'set protocol.file.allow_special_files = 1' file:///dev/stdin
Use whichever suits you more ;-). Note that reading document from
stdin WORKS ONLY WHEN YOU USE -dump OR -source!! (I would like to
know why you would use -source -stdin, though ;-)
.TP
\fB-touch-files [0|1] (default: 0) \fR
Set to 1 to have runtime state files (bookmarks, history, ...)
changed even when -no-connect or -session-ring is used; has no
effect if not used in connection with any of these options.
.TP
\fB-version \fR
Print ELinks version information and exit.
