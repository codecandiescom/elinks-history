Known bugs:


	Can't connect to some FTP servers (Novell, NT). Connection stays in
"Request sent" state.

	Frames don't work if there's more frames with same name. Turn them off
in such case.

	You can't upload large files; it takes _lots_ of memory.

	You shouldn't press '^Z' when you are in a viewer

	Handling of &#13; is not lynx-compatible in <pre> tag (should be
newline).

	Tags inside <XMP> are still interpreted.

	DNS lookups / IPv6 support may not be yet entirely stable.

	links '...?q=foo+bar' when launching new instance in xterm leads to
incorrectly decoding +ba to 0xba.

	When switching between source view and rendered view, the position of
the view is based on the page number of the previous view, not on the content of
the previous view.

	Calling cfmakeraw() in kbd.c:setraw() breaks some exotic terminal
combinations.

	When doing -dump on broken sites like groups.yahoo.com, links can get
stuck bouncing in redirects around unhappily, as we don't check for
MAX_REDIRECTS - AFAIK not an easy AND nice way how to, as we don't have needed
field in structure passed to end_dump().

	Sometimes you can manage to get two httpauth login dialogs at once -
then the second one will crash links when you'll close it.
