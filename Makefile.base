# The author of automake should be shot, quartered and forced to code in COBOL
# for the rest of his days for the **** he designed - anything forcing me to
# -I. -I$(srcdir) regardless if I want or not is just idiotic. Another totally
# dumb thing is that you can't just use @CONFIG_INCLUDE_SPEC@ in your own .am.

COMPILE = $(CC) @DEFS@ $(INCLUDES) $(AM_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)

# Rule for getting test dependencies right. This is a workaround since
# automake doesn't support defining subdirs sources.
testutils:
	cd $(top_builddir) ; make -C src/util CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG"
