	   Documentation README - Overview of the ELinks documentation	|title|

   There is only limited documentation available for ELinks, sorry. It basically
   consists of the documents in this directory, the manpages and the {README}
   and {INSTALL} files in the project's root directory.

The directory structure

   In this directory you will find:

   man/									|term|

	The place where the manpages live. They are generated from the DocBook
	documents found in doc/book/manpages.

   html/								|term|

	Will (in the future) contain processed DocBook documents.  Manual pages
	and man pages should be already processed.

ELinks DocTool

   Since |DocBook| seems to be a lot of work to get it running on multiple
   platforms I am investigating going for something simpler. Something that will
   need only the standard UN*X tools to run, an ELinks doctool. This tool will
   be build upon some achitecture similar to {|help2doc|} currently used for
   generating |elinks.conf(5)|.

  The format

   The basic format will be something similar to how ELinks renders HTML pages
   and probably inspired by |AsciiDoc| and |Vim| help files. We can then
   *easily* distribute the documentation source (_human_readable_ plain text
   files like this one) with the source. Any user can then:

	% cd doc && make htmldocs

   or similar to generate a desired format. It will support translation to the
   core formats: HTML and man. Which means it will also be used for the web
   pages. With possibility to extend it with DocBook later.

  Other uses

   One thing I'd also like to use it for is the option declarations. The current
   scheme is hard to read and update. Something like:

	= Option =							|code|
	Name:		tofu.burgers.rock
	Type:		boolean
	Value:		1
	Flags:		0
	Caption:	They just do
	Description:
	   And so on about the tasty stuff.
	   .
	   You can also make them with humus.

   or similar that could easily be translated to some {options.inc} file would
   be much better. This is however far ahead and solely my opinion.

   A Vim |syntax file| is available.

   TODO: The first step will be to translate this document to HTML.
