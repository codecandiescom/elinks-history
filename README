History
~~~~~~~

Initially, ELinks was a development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW browser),
with more liberal features policy and development style.

Its purpose was to provide an alternative to Links, and to test and tune various
new features, but still provide good rock-solid releases inside stable branches.
If you are more interested, you can examine the Links website at
http://links.sf.net/.

Why not contribute to Links instead?  Well, first I made a bunch of patches for
the original Links, but a significant number of them got refused  because
Mikulas did not like them, as he just wouldn't have any use for them himself.
He wants to keep Links with a relatively closed feature set and merge only new
features which he himself needs.  It has advantages that the tree is very narrow
and the code is small and contains very little bloat.  ELinks, on the contrary,
aims to provide a full-featured web browser, superior to both lynx and w3m and
with the possibilities of Konqueror and similar browsers. However, to prevent
drastic bloating of the code, the development is driven in the course of
modularization and separation of add-on modules (like cookies, bookmarks, ssl,
lua etc).
